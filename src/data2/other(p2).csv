Heading: Ultrasound Abdomen Report

The ultrasound abdomen report indicates the following findings:

- Liver is enlarged in size  measuring 24 cm  with normal shape and echotexture. Multiple well-defined heterogeneous hypoechoic lesions are seen in both lobes of the liver  the largest measuring 11 x 10.5 x 13.8 cm in the right lobe. Most of these lesions show a target sign  and the larger ones have an internal cystic component likely indicating necrosis. Peripheral vascularity is seen on color flow. The largest lesion in the left lobe of the liver measures 5.4 x 5.1 cm in segment II.
- Intrahepatic bile ducts are not dilated. The portal vein is dilated  measuring 14.6 mm  and shows turbulent flow.
- The gallbladder is partially distended  with a clear visualized lumen and normal wall thickness. The common bile duct is within normal limits.
- The pancreas is normal in size and echopattern.
- The spleen is normal in size and echopattern.
- Both kidneys are normal in size  shape  and echopattern  with no space-occupying lesions or hydronephrosis.
- The urinary bladder is partially distended  with a clear lumen and normal wall thickness.
- The uterus is anteverted and normal in size  with an endometrial thickness of 3.4 mm. No gross adnexal masses are seen bilaterally.
- Minimal inter-bowel free fluid is seen in the pelvis.

Impression:
In a known case of GIST (Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor) on Imatinib  the present scan shows hepatomegaly with multiple liver lesions and minimal ascites. The findings need to be correlated clinically and with previous records.

Heading: Ultrasound & Diagnostic Centre Report

This is a medical report from Alpha Ultrasound & Diagnostic Centre  an ISO 9001:2015 certified facility. The report is for the patient Mr. ILTEEJA HASAN  a 29-year-old male.

The report includes the following information:

BIOCHEMISTRY:
Test Name: BLOOD GLUCOSE FASTING
Results: 88.10 mg/dl
Bio Ref. Interval: <100

CLINICAL NOTES:
The clinical notes discuss the interpretation of the fasting blood glucose result. It states that a fasting blood glucose level below 100 mg/dl is considered normal  while a level between 100-126 mg/dl indicates impaired glucose tolerance (pre-diabetes)  and a level of 126 mg/dl or above on two separate occasions confirms the diagnosis of diabetes.

The report also mentions that the possible causes of a high blood glucose level could be due to stress  anxiety  exaggerated response of insulin  and other factors that can affect blood glucose levels  especially in women with lower body weight and those who are physically active.

The report is signed by Dr. PIYUSH DI  Dr. MD ARIF  and Dr. PANKAJ VARSHNEY  who are the Consultant Pathologist  Consultant Biochemist  and Lab Director  respectively.

The report also lists the various facilities available at the Alpha Ultrasound & Diagnostic Centre  including 4D Ultrasound  Colour Doppler  Digital X-Ray  Pulmonary Function Test (PFT)  and ECG.

Heading: Case History

A 34-year-old man noticed tingling sensations in his feet  followed by shooting pain in his legs. After several months  he had difficulty walking at night  needing to watch the ground to avoid falling. On examination  his legs were strong  but he would stagger and sway while walking. There was no muscle weakness or atrophy  but the muscles lacked normal tone when relaxed. The knee jerk was absent  and there was complete loss of proprioception (sense of posture and passive movement) and vibratory sense in the legs. There was also loss of tactile localization and discrimination.

{{MEDICALLY_RELEVANT}}
Heading: Diagnosis and Affected Tracts

1. Diagnosis: Sensory ataxia
2. The damaged tracts are the dorsal column tracts.
3. The incoordination of the legs while walking and the loss of proprioception (sense of posture and passive movement) are due to the impairment of the dorsal column tracts  which are responsible for transmitting proprioceptive information from the legs to the brain.

Kata zakat ) L)'CN 2N ) berasal dari bahasa Arab  secara bahasa artinya suci  tumbuh
berkembang dan berkah. Makna zakat secara bahasa ini mencerminkan sifat zakat
yang dapat mensucikan harta dan jiwa serta mengandung nilai positif yang dapat
dikembangkan berupa kebaikan bagi si muzakki dan kemaslahatan ekonomi bagi para
mustahiq. Sebagaimana firman Allah swt:
'GN 'CQN 2N LFR EN L-N NDAR N #L/R NB
Artinya: Sesungguhnya beruntunglah orang-orang yang mensucikan dirinya. (QS.
al-Syams: 9)
Menurut syara  para ulama mendefinisikannya dengan Harta tertentu yang
wajib dikeluarkan sebagiannya kepada para mustahiq. Sedangkan Sayyid Sabiq
mendefinisikan  Zakat adalah suatu nama hak Allah yang harus dikeluarkan oleh manusia
kepada fuqara. Selanjutnya Sabiq menambahkan  Dinamakan zakat karena mengharap
berkah  pensucian diri  dan bertambahnya kebaikan. Hal ini sejalan dengan firman Allah
swt:
'GN (P LER GP JC P 2N O*HN LER GO 1O G P 7N O*LK )NBN/5N LER GP DP'HN ER N #LFR EP L0R .O
Artinya: Ambilah dari harta mereka shadaqah yang dapat membersihkan harta dan
mensucikan jiwa mereka. (QS. At-Taubah: 103).
Dari dua macam pengertian zakat seperti diungkapkan di atas dapat
disimpulkan bahwa zakat adalah kewajiban seseorang untuk mengeluarkan sebagian
harta miliknya yang sudah memenuhi syarat untuk dizakati kepada orang yang
berhak menerimanya (mustahiq).
Zakat sering juga disebut shadaqah ( )B/5) karena tindakan itu adalah
tindakan yang benar (shidq). Istilah zakat dalam al-Qur'an sering sekali
penyebutannya digandengkan dengan kata sholat  ditemukan sebanyak 82 ayat.
Penyelarasan ini menunjukkan bahwa zakat merupakan rukun Islam yang sangat
penting setelah perkara sholat.

A. ZAKAT HASIL TANAH YANG DISEWAKAN
Dalam istilah ekonomi  zakat merupakan suatu tindakan pemindahan harta
kekayaan dari golongan kaya kepada golongan miskin (mustahik). Transfer kekayaan
berarti juga transfer sumber-sumber ekonomi. Rahardjo (1987) menyatakan bahwa
dengan menggunakan pendekatan ekonomi  zakat bisa berkembang menjadi konsep
kemasyarakatan (muamalah)  yaitu konsep tentang bagaimana cara manusia
melakukan kehidupan bermasyarakat termasuk di dalamnya bentuk ekonomi. Oleh
karena itu ada dua konsep yang selalu dikemukakan dalam pembahasan mengenai
sosial ekonomi Islam yang saling berkaitan yaitu pelarangan riba dan perintah
membayar zakat (Q.S al-Baqarah [2]: 276).
Mencermati judul di atas setidaknya terdapat pertanyaan dalam benak
saudara  siapa yang wajib mengeluarkan zakat dari tanah yang disewakan  apakah si
pemilik tanah atau pihak penyewa tanah. Sepintas jawabannya sudah dapat
ditentukan dari judul itu yaitu orang yang menyewa tanah karena dialah orang yang
mendapatkan secara langsung dari hasil tanah tersebut. Namun demikian 
ditemukan pendapat bahwa si pemilik tanahlah yang terkena kewajiban zakatnya
karena tanpa tanah tidak mungkin didapati hasil tanaman. Terdapat juga pendapat
yang mengatakan bahwa hukumnya dikembalikan kepada kesepakatan antara dua
belah pihak sebelum transaksi dilakukan  berikut bahasannya.
1. Pengertian dan Dasar Hukum Zakat Tanah yang Disewakan
Setelah memahami pengertian zakat  maka perlu juga memahami pengertian
sewa-menyewa atau ijarah. Sewa-menyewa adalah memanfaatkan suatu barang baik
barang milik sendiri atau barang orang lain. Istilah ini dikenal dalam Bahasa Arab
disebut dengan istilah ijarah yang berasal dari kata al-ajru yang mengandung arti upah
atau menjual manfaat. Zuhaily yang dikutip oleh Ismail Nawawi dalam bukunya
yang berjudul Fiqh Muamalah Klasik dan Kontemporer mengatakan bahwa
Transaksi sewa (ijarah) identik dengan jual beli  tetapi dalam sewa pemilikan
dibatasi dengan waktu tertentu.
10

Akad ijarah dianggap sah jika memenuhi rukun-rukunya yang meliputi
pertama  Mujir dan mustajir  yaitu pihak-pihak yang melakukan akad sewa. Mujir
yakni orang yang menyewa  mustajir yakni orang yang memberi sewa. Kedua  Sighat 
ijab qabul antara mujir dan mustajir. Ketiga  Ajr atau upah yang dibayarkan dan
keempat  Barang yang disewakan.
Dengan demikian  pengertian zakat tanah yang disewakan adalah zakat yang
dikeluarkan dari tanah yang disewakan. Zakat tanah yang disewakan harus
memenuhi beberapa komponen dalam transaksi zakat hasil tanah yang disewakan
sebagai berikut:
a. Sebidang tanah yang disewakan ( O )1N  N R #N*3R EO DR'L6O 1R ND#LN#)
b. Pemilik tanah ( O 61R ND#N#L (K -P '5N ): Orang yang menyewakan tanahnya kepada
orang lain.
c. Penyewa tanah( O 1 P R #N*3R EO DRN#) sekaligus penggarap tanah yang disewakan.
d. Ajru (upah) yang dibayarkan oleh penyewa kepada pemilik tanah.
Berdasar kepada beberapa ketentuan di atas  dalam penyewaan tanah 
sedikitnya terdapat dua pihak yang terlibat dalam transaksi penyewaan tanah yaitu
pemilik tanah dan penyewa  yang keduanya bersepakat mengadakan transaksi.
Dengan kata lain  zakat hasil tanah yang disewakan ( O )1N  N R #N*3R EO DR'L6P 1R ND'R'LO)'LCN 2N ) dapat
diartikan sebagai zakat hasil tanah yang langsung dihasilkan oleh tanah tersebut
berupa tumbuh-tumbuhan yang menghasilkan buah. Hasil dimaksud bisa berupa
makanan pokok  seperti padi  kurma  gandum atau buah-buahan  seperti  jeruk 
anggur  semangka  atau berupa sayur-sayuran  seperti ketimun  kacang  bawang  dan
lain sebagainya. Kewajiban untuk mengeluarkan zakat hasil tanah yang disewakan
didasari oleh ayat berikut ini:
LFN HO*JR 2QN D'HN LOGODCO O #L'KADPN*.R EO L9N 1R 2QN D'HN LDN .R QNFD'HN L*M '4N H1O 9R EN L1N JR :N HN L*M '4N H1O 9R EN L*M 'QNF N LN #4N FRN #LJ0P QN D'LHN GO HN

LFN JPA1P 3R EO DR 'L(QO -P OJLD'N LOGQNFP%
Artinya: Dan Dialah yang telah menjadikan kebun-kebun yang berjunjung dan yang
tidak berjunjung  pohon korma  tumbuh-tumbuhan yang beraneka ragam buahnya  zaitun
dan delima yang serupa bentuk dan warnanya dan tidak sama rasanya. Makanlah buah-
buah tersebut jika panen dan keluarkanlah haknya (zakatnya) ketika panen. Dan janganlah
11

kamu berlebih-lebihan. Sesungguhnya Allah tidak suka kepada orang yang berlebih-
lebihan. (QS. al-Anam: 141)
Sedangkan dasar dari Hadits mengenai wajibnya zakat hasil tanah:
L1P 4O O9DR'LAO 5R PFL)P NJPF'3QN D'P(LJ
N
BP 3O L'EN JR PAL1O HR 4O O9DR'LEO JR N:DR'HN 1O 'GN FR ND'R'L*P NB3N L'EN JR PA
(ED3EHL/E-'LG'H1)
Artinya: Tanaman yang tumbuh diari oleh air yang menggunakan alat  zakatnya
sebanyak lima persen. Sedangkan tanaman yang diairi oleh air hujan sebanyak sepuluh
persen.
Jika dicermati  mengapa hasil tanah yang diairi oleh alat lebih kecil dari pada
yang diairi oleh air hujan? Hal ini karena yang memakai alat itu membutuhkan biaya 
sedangkan yang memakai air hujan tidak membutuhkan biaya. Dengan demikian 
terdapat keadilan di dalamnya.
Zakat hasil tanah wajib dikeluarkan zakatnya setiap panen  tidak berlaku
untuknya haul (genap satu tahun) di dalamnya. Jika satu tahun itu dua kali panen 
maka zakatnya pun dua kali. Sedangkan ketentuan nisabnya menurut M. Syaltut  baik
sedikit atau banyak hasil panennya tetap dizakatkan karena menurutnya agar
tumbuh selalu sikap solidaritas sosial sebagai hikmah diwajibkannya zakat.
Menurut Majma al-Faqih al-Islam yang dikutip oleh Wahbah Zuhaili tentang
zakat harta yang tidak bergerak dan tanah yang disewakan terutama tanah yang
disewakan bukan untuk pertanian maka tidak ada kewajiban zakat pada aset harta
tidak bergerak dan tanah yang disewakan karena yang wajib dizakati adalah hasil
pemasukan dari harta yang tidak bergerak dan tanah yang disewakan itu. Jika tanah
yang disewakan itu menghasilkan seperti pertanian atau apapun yang dikelolanya
maka wajib mengeluarkan zakat sebesar 2 5 % setelah berlalunya waktu satu tahun
(haul) dari waktu al-qabdhu (penyerahterimaan) dengan tetap memperhatikan
terpenuhinya syarat-syarat zakat dan tidak ada hal-hal yang menghalanginya.
2. Siapa yang Wajib Mengeluarkan Zakatnya
Ketentuan bahwa zakat hasil tanah yang disewakan wajib dikeluarkan
zakatnya tidak memunculkan masalah jika tanah itu ditanami oleh pemiliknya
langsung. Persoalannya jika tanah itu disewakan kepada orang lain  maka hal ini akan
12

memunculkan masalah  siapa yang wajib mengeluarkan zakat hasil tanah yang
disewakan? Apakah si pemilik tanah atau si penyewa tanah (yang bercocok tanam).
Untuk menjawab kasus hukum ini tidak terdapat kata sepakat di kalangan para ulama
mereka berselisih dalam menetapkan hukumnya seperti diuraikan berikut ini.
Pertama  menurut Jumhur ulama  bahwa yang wajib mengeluarkan zakat hasil
tanah yang disewakan adalah pihak penyewa. Mereka beralasan karena yang
dikeluarkan zakatnya adalah hasil tanahnya bukan tanahnya hal ini diperkuat oleh
pendapat Mahmud Syaltut.

Artinya:Pendapat yang kami pegang bahwasanya kewajiban zakat ada pada pihak
penyewa yang langsung menggarap pertanian. Dan zakat merupakan hak pertanian
sebagai rasa syukur atas nimat berhasilnya pertanian. Dengan demikian penyewalah
yang dibebani untuk mengeluarkan zakat hasil tanah yang disewakan.
Kedua  menurut pendapat Abu Hanifah dan pengikutnya bahwa pemilik
tanahlah yang wajib mengeluarkan zakatnya karena dari sebab tanah itulah ada hasil
yang diperoleh.  tanpa tanah tak akan dapat dihasilkan apa-apa.
Ketiga  Imam Malik  Syafii  Imam At-Tsauri  Imam Ibnu Mubarak dan Imam
Ibnu Abu Tsaur berpendapat  penyewa tanahlah yang wajib membayar zakat 
pendapat ini sejalan dengan pendapat poin pertama.
Mencermati perselisihan pendapat tentang zakat hasil tanah yang disewakan
sebagaimana tersebut di atas dapat dikelompokkan perbedaannya menjadi dua
kelompok dengan alasannya masing-masing.
Pendapat pertama adalah ulama yang menetapkan bahwa si penyewa dalam
hal ini orang yang menggarap tanah yang wajib mengeluarkan zakat karena dialah
yang secara langsung memperoleh hasil dari tanah tersebut. Sedangkan pendapat
kedua menetapkan bahwa si pemilik tanahlah yang wajib mengeluarkan zakatnya
karena si pemilik tanah tersebut mendapatkan uang sewa. Jika diperbandingkan
alasan dari kedua kelompok tersebut  maka pendapat pertama memiliki argumentasi
yang lebih kuat karena hal ini diperkuat oleh firman Allah swt dalam surat al-Anam
13

ayat 141 seperti tersebut di atas yang menyebutkan bahwa hasil tanah yang wajib
dikeluarkan zakatnya bukan tanahnya. Diperkuat pula oleh Hadits Rasulullah
sebagaimana tersebut di atas. Berdasarkan kepada dalil-dali tersebut  fuqaha telah
sepakat bahwa yang dizakatkan adalah hasil tanah bukan tanahnya; maka sebidang
tanah yang tidak ditanami tidak wajib dikeluarkan zakatnya. Dengan demikian  tanah
yang disewakan jika dilihat dari hasilnya itu adalah milik sempurna pihak si
penyewa. Maka tidaklah tepat alasan yang diajukan oleh kelompok kedua yang
berpendapat bahwa pemilik tanahlah yang wajib mengeluarkan zakatnya.
Terkait dengan status tanah yang disewakan itu tetap milik orang yang
menyewakan dan di sisi lain terdapat kewajiban untuk mengeluarkan kewajiban
pajak. Jika berpegang kepada pendapat pertama seperti dijelaskan di atas maka
sebenarnya dengan status tersebut terjadi pembagian kewajiban yang cukup merata
karena kedua belah pihak memiliki andil  yakni si penyewa wajib membayar zakat
dan di sisi lain si pemilik tanah membayar pajak tanah  maka pendapat pertama ini
dipandang lebih adil dan tidak memberatkan kedua-belah pihak.
Solusi lain yang juga dapat dipandang bijak dalam pemerataan pengeluaran
zakat adalah pendapat yang ditawarkan oleh Abu Zahra. Menurutnya  kedua-duanya
baik si pemilik tanah maupun si penyewa sama-sama wajib mengeluarkan zakat. Hal
ini demi memenuhi keadilan dalam pemungutan zakat  dengan ketentuan pihak
penyewa mengeluarkan zakat tanaman setelah dikurangi harga sewa yang ia bayar
kepada pemilik tanah; sedangkan pemilik tanah mengeluarkan zakat atas dasar harga
sewa yang ia terima dari si penyewa; yang berarti ia mengeluarkan zakat uang.
Dengan demikian keduanya terkena beban untuk mengeluarkan zakat.
Solusi lain yang dapat dipertimbangkan adalah jika kedua belah pihak sebelum
transaksi telah bersepakat untuk mengeluarkan zakatnya patungan dengan tujuan
agar keduanya tidak terlalu terbebani  maka zakat itu dapat dilakukan secara
patungan antara kedua belah pihak berdasarkan kesepakatan itu.
Adapun ketentuan zakat tanah yang disewakan untuk kegiatan usaha tersebut
diqiyaskan pada zakat perdagangan. Besaran nishabnya setara nishab emas dan perak
senilai 85 gram emas murni  zakatnya sebesar 2 5 %. Cara menghitung zakat
14

perdagangan yakni jumlah total harta dikurangi total biaya yang telah dikeluarkan 
kemudian dikalikan dengan 2 5 %.
Ketentuan di atas mensyaratkan syarat-syarat sebagai berikut: pertama  ada
niat yang diikuti usaha berdagang atau mengelola tanah. Kedua  mencapai waktu
satu tahun (haul) dihitung dari waktu usaha berdagang. Ketiga  mencapai nishab.
Keempat  harta dagang telah menjadi hak milik sempurna  telah dibeli secara tunai.
Kelima  tidak terkait hutang dengan pihak lain.
B. ZAKAT HASIL JASA (PROFESI)
Terhadap hukum zakat profesi  terdapat perbedaan pendapat diantara ulama.
Hal ini antara lain dikarenakan dasar hukum tentang zakat yang dikeluarkan dari
hasil usaha tersebut masih bersifat zhan (dugaan)  berikut bahasannya.
1. Pengertian dan Hukumnya
Dalam terminologi Arab  zakat penghasilan dan profesi lebih populer disebut
dengan istilah zakatu kasb al-amal wa al-mihan al- hurrah ( )1-D'LFGED'HLDE9D'L(3CL)'C2)  atau
zakat atas penghasilan kerja dan profesi bebas. Istilah itu digunakan oleh Yusuf Al-
Qardhawi dalam kitab Fiqhu Zakah dan Wahbah Az-Zuhaili dalam kitab Al Fiqhul
Islami wa Adillatuhu.
Kata profesi menurut kamus besar Bahasa Indonesia mengandung arti
sebidang pekerjaan yang dilandasi oleh pendidikan keahlian berupa keterampilan
dan kejuruan tertentu. Profesi secara istilah berarti suatu pekerjaan yang
membutuhkan pengetahuan  keahlian  dan kepintaran. Yusuf al-Qardhawi lebih jelas
mengemukakan bahwa profesi adalah pekerjaan atau usaha yang menghasilkan uang
atau kekayaan baik pekerjaan atau usaha itu dilakukan sendiri  tanpa bergantung
kepada orang lain  maupun dengan bergantung kepada orang lain  seperti
pemerintah  perusahaan swasta  maupun dengan perorangan dengan memperoleh
upah  gaji  atau honorarium.
Berdasar pengertian profesi di atas  maka zakat profesi dapat dimaknai sebagai
zakat pekerjaan yang sudah menjadi keahlian seseorang yang diperoleh melalui
proses pendidikan seperti dokter  dosen  pengacara  pilot  dan guru  semua contoh
15

pekerjaan ini dapat dikatakan profesi karena keahliannya diperoleh melalui proses
pendidikan yang cukup lama.
Gagasan zakat profesi dipelopori oleh Yusuf Qardhawi dalam kitabnya Fiqh Az
Zakah  yang cetakan pertamanya terbit tahun 1969. Namun tampaknya Yusuf
Qardhawi dalam hal ini mendapat pengaruh dari dua ulama lainnya  yaitu Abdul
Wahhab Khallaf dan Abu Zahrah. Dalil ayat al-Quran yang dijadikan dasar bagi
kewajiban zakat profesi yaitu QS. al-Baqarah. 267. Pekerjaan yang termasuk profesi
bersifat umum  tidak terbatas oleh keahlian yang diperoleh dari pendidikan; namun
juga mencakup semua jenis pekerjaan yang baik. Hal ini dipahami dari ayat :
LER O*(R 3N CN L'EN L*P 'N( JP 7N LFR EP L'HOBAP FRN #L'HOFEN '!N LFN J0P QN D'L'GN QOJN #'NJ
Artinya: Nafkahkanlah dari hasil usahamu yang baik. (QS. al-Baqarah: 267)
Dilihat dari ketergantungannya  profesi bisa dikelompokkan menjadi dua
bagian. Pertama  pekerja ahli yang berdiri sendiri  tidak terikat oleh pemerintah 
seperti dokter swasta  insinyur  pengacara  penjahit  tukang batu  guru  dosen 
wartawan dan konsultan. Kedua  profesi yang terkait dengan pemerintah atau
yayasan atau badan usaha yang menerima gaji setiap bulan. Menurut sebagian ulama 
seperti Ibnu Abbas  Ibnu Masud  dan Muawiyah  kedua kelompok profesi di atas 
baik yang wiraswasta atau pegawai yang terikat oleh suatu instansi  mereka dapat
terkena kewajiban mengeluarkan zakat profesinya ketika menerima upah/gaji
sebesar seperempat puluhnya. Jika rutinitas itu dilakukan maka tidak ada lagi
baginya kewajiban untuk mengeluarkan zakat pada akhir tahun.
Dilihat dari aspek penerimaannya  macam-macam profesi seperti tersebut di
atas dapat dikategorikan menjadi dua. Pertama  hasil usaha yang teratur dan pasti
setiap bulannya  yang termasuk ke dalam kelompok pertama ini seperti upah pekerja
dan gaji pegawai. Kedua  hasil yang tidak tetap dan tidak dapat dipastikan seperti
kontraktor  pengacara  royalti pengarang  konsultan  dan artis.
Dengan demikian  zakat profesi meliputi semua pekerjaan yang halal dan baik.
Zakat dapat dikeluarkan sesuai dengan waktu perolehannya setelah diambil terlebih
dahulu untuk kewajiban biaya terhadap keluarga dan biaya operasional. Seseorang
dengan profesinya yang berpenghasilan pas-pasan bahkan kurang untuk memenuhi
16

kebutuhan hidupnya bukanlah termasuk profesi yang wajib dikeluarkan zakatnya 
bahkan mereka tergolong orang yang berhak menerima zakat (mustahiq); seperti
tukang becak.
Dengan demikian  zakat profesi merupakan zakat wajib yang harus
dikeluarkan umat islam  apabila sudah memenuhi syarat untuk menjadi muzakki.
Indikator pengeluaran zakat profesi merupakan penghasilan yang diperoleh.
Semakin besar penghasilan  maka semakin besar juga zakat yang harus dikeluarkan.
Karena itu  ulama menetapkan nishab zakat prof disetarakan dengan zakat emas 
yakni minimal memiliki harta yang setara dengan harga 85% gram emas. Adapun
syarat-syarat lain yang harus dipenuhi adalah 1) harta kepemilikan penuh  yakni
harta profesi benar-benar milik sendiri; 2) penghasilan sudah memenuhi kebutuhan
pokok; dan 3)telah mencapai nishab; berdasarkan fatwa MUI minimal setara dengan
85 gram emas; sedangkan pendapat Abu Zahra  minimal setara dengan 930 liter atau
653 kg hasil panen. Sedangkan jumhur ulama yang dikutip oleh Sulaiman Rasyid
menetapkan nishabnya adalah setara dengan 93  6 gram Emas. Sedang syarat 4)  
bebas dari hutang; yakni muzakki benar-benar bebas dari hutang.
Fatwa Majelis Ulama Indonesia (MUI) menjelaskan bahwa penghasilan yang
dimaksud ialah setiap pendapatan seperti gaji  honorarium  upah  jasa  dan lain-
lainnya yang diperoleh dengan cara halal  baik rutin seperti pejabat negara  pegawai 
karyawan  maupun tidak rutin seperti dokter  pengacara  konsultan  dan sejenisnya 
serta pendapatan yang diperoleh dari pekerjaan bebas lainnya.
2. Cara Mengeluarkan dan Nisabnya
Berikut ini akan dijelaskan secara singkat cara mengeluarkan zakat profesi
seperti dokter  pengacara  pilot  dosen  artis dan sebagainya. Semua pekerja ini dapat
mengeluarkan zakat profesinya dengan cara tajil  yaitu mempercepat ketika mereka
menerima honor atau gaji. Berapa nisab (batas minimal) dan prosentase yang harus
dikeluarkan? Terjadi perbedaan pendapat para ulama terhadap penetapan nisabnya:
a. Abdurrahman Hasan  Imam Abu Zahra  dan Abdul Wahab Khallaf  mereka
berpendapat bahwa nisab zakat profesi sekurang-kurangnya setara dengan lima
17

wasaq atau 300 sha sekitar 930 liter atau 653 Kg hasil panen. Persentase zakat
disamakan (diqiyaskan) dengan zakat pertanian yang pengairannya
menggunakan alat (mesin)  yaitu sebesar 5 % setiap mendapatkan gaji atau honor.
b. Jumhur ulama berijtihad bahwa nisab zakat profesi adalah harta setara dengan
seharga emas 93 6 gram emas murni yang diambil dari penghasilan bersih setelah
dikeluarkan seluruh biaya hidup. Kelebihan inilah yang dihitung selama satu
tahun  lalu dikeluarkan zakatnya sebanyak 2 5 % setiap bulan. Prosentase ini
diqiyaskan dengan zakat mata uang yang telah ditetapkan oleh Hadits.
c. Terdapat juga pendapat yang mengatakan bahwa zakat profesi disamakan
dengan zakat rikaz (barang temuan) maka tidak ada syarat nisab dan
prosentasenya 20 persen pada saat menerimanya.
d. Majelis Ulama Indonesia (MUI) dalam fatwa MUI No 3 tanggal 7 Juni tahun 2003
menyebutkan bahwa semua bentuk penghasilan halal wajib dikeluarkan
zakatnya dengan syarat telah mencapai nishab dalam satu tahun  yakni senilai
emas 85 gram dalam setahun. Zakat penghasilan dapat dikeluarkan pada saat
menerima jika sudah cukup nishab. Jika tidak mencapai nishab  maka semua
penghasilan dikumpulkan selama satu tahun; kemudian zakat dikeluarkan jika
penghasilan bersihnya sudah cukup nishab.
C. Contoh Kasus
Ali adalah seorang pendidik golongan IV/a dengan masa kerja selama 20
tahun. Ia memiliki seorang istri dan tiga anak. Penghasilannya tiap bulan pada
tahun 2015 sebagai berikut:
a. Gaji dari Negara Rp. 4.300.000
c. Honor dari beberapa PTS Rp. 2.500.000
d. Honor dari yang lain Rp. 2.000.000
Pengeluaran setiap bulan:
a. Keperluan keluarga Rp. 3.000.000
b. Angsuran kredit rumah Rp. 1.250.000
18

c. Dan lain-lain Rp. 1.500.000
Kalkulasi
Penerimaan Rp. 8.800.000
Pengeluaran Rp. 5.750.000
Sisa Rp. 3.050.000
Jika sisa di atas dikalikan setahun  maka berjumlah Rp. 36.600.000. Jumlah
tersebut tidak memenuhi nisab emas  yakni 85 gram emas yang pada tahun 2015
seharga Rp 525.000 per gram  atau sekitar Rp .44.625.00. Dengan demikian  maka Pak
Ali belum diwajibkan mengeluarkan zakat.
Contoh lainnya adalah sebagai berikut:
Andi adalah seorang eksekutif muda di sebuah perusahaan IT.
Penghasilannya tiap bulan pada tahun 2021 sebagai berikut 
a. Gaji Pokok Rp. 15.000.000
b. Bonus dan Insentif Rp. 12.500.000
c. Honor dari yang lain Rp. 7.500.000
Pengeluaran setiap bulan:
a. Keperluan keluarga Rp. 5.000.000
b. Dan lain-lain Rp. 10.000.000
Kalkulasi
Penerimaan Rp. 25.000.000
Pengeluaran Rp. 15.000.000
Sisa Rp. 10.000.000
Jika sisa di atas dikalikan setahun  maka berjumlah Rp. 120.000.000. Jumlah
tersebut telah memenuhi nisab emas  yakni 85 gram emas yang pada tahun 2021
seharga Rp 79.738.415 -. Dengan demikian  maka Pak Andi diwajibkan mengeluarkan
zakat dengan perhitungan 2 5 % x Rp. 120.000.000 = Rp. 3.000. 000. Bila Pak Andi
mengeluarkannya secara tajil atau didahulukan  maka Pak Andi dapat
mengeluarkannya secara bulanan  hingga beliau hanya membayar Rp. 250.000 setiap
bulannya.

Uraian di atas merupakan konsep zakat profesi bagi yang mendukung adanya
zakat profesi. Namun dengan demikian  terdapat juga ulama yang mengatakan
bahwa zakat profesi itu tidak ada dengan alasan karena sulit menentukan jenis profesi
dan nisabnya. Mereka yang menolak zakat profesi tersebut karena mereka
memasukkan zakat profesi kepada zakat harta yang harus dibayar jika sudah
sempurna satu tahun (haul); dan mempertahankan harta dengan nilai nisab selama
satu tahun dari berbagai kebutuhan bukanlah sesuatu hal yang mudah.
Perlu dipahami bahwa mengeluarkan zakat adalah manifestasi dari keislaman
seseorang sebagai rasa syukur kepada Allah swt atas nikmat yang telah diterimanya.
Di antara nikmat tersebut adalah karena memiliki profesi. Maka ijtihad yang
menetapkan adanya zakat profesi yang belum pernah ada pada zaman klasik Islam
perlu direspons secara positif. Hukum Islam selalu relevan dengan perkembangan
zaman. Zakat profesi adalah hasil ijtihad yang sejalan dengan prinsip hukum Islam
yang memberikan pintu kemudahan  dalam hal ini penunaian zakat secara tajil
(disegerakan) sehingga dapat menghilangkan kealpaan seseorang dalam penunaian
zakat.
Seseorang dikatakan sudah wajib menunaikan zakat penghasilan apabila
mampu menyisihkan bagian dari penghasilannya dan mencapai nishab zakat
pendapatan yang minimal setara dengan harga 85 gram emas per tahun. Hal ini juga
dikuatkan dalam SK BAZNAS Tahun 2021 Tentang Nisab Zakat Pendapatan dan Jasa
tahun 2021  bahwa;
Nishab zakat pendapatan/ penghasilan pada tahun 2021 adalah senilai 85
gram emas atau setara dengan Rp79.738.415 - (Tujuh puluh sembilan juta tujuh
ratus tiga puluh delapan empat ratus lima belas rupiah) per tahun atau
Rp6.644.868 - (Enam juta enam ratus empat puluh empat ribu delapan ratus
enam puluh delapan rupiah) per bulan.
Dalam praktiknya  zakat penghasilan dapat ditunaikan setiap bulan dengan
nilai nishab penghasilan setiap bulan minimal 6.644.868. Mereka yang telah mampu
menyisihkan dari harta penghasilan dengan jumlah tersebut wajib mengeluarkan
zakatnya 2 5%. Sebagian berpendapat  bahwa nisab tersebut bukanlah diambil dari
sisa penghasilan setelah dikurangi dari kebutuhan pokok; namun dari jumlah
20

penghasilan secara keseluruhan tanpa harus dipotong untuk kebutuhan pokoknya;
sebab kebutuhan pokok terkadang sering dibuat-buat untuk menghindari kewajiban
mengeluarkan zakat profesinya.
C. ZAKAT PRODUKTIF
Kemunculan istilah di atas dapat dikatakan sebagai sebuah bentuk kritik
terhadap penyaluran zakat kepada mustahiq yang pada umumnya bersifat konsumtif.
Zakat yang diterima oleh mustahiq biasanya bersifat konvensional yaitu sekedar
untuk memenuhi kebutuhan hidup sehari-hari yang sifatnya menghabiskan.
Namun di sisi lain terdapat mustahiq yang keberadaannya masih produktif baik dari
tenaga  ilmu dan keterampilan. Mustahiq yang masih mampu produktif tersebut dapat
diberikan zakat berupa modal usaha untuk pengembangan kemampuan yang
dimilikinya. Permasalahannya yang kemudian muncul bagaimana hukum
penyaluran zakat untuk modal usaha? berikut bahasannya.
1. Gagasan Zakat Produktif
Zakat merupakan ibadah maal (materi) yang memiliki fungsi strategis untuk
membangun perekonomian umat Islam. Kedudukannya sebagai salah satu rukun
Islam mengharuskan umat Islam untuk mengimani dan melaksanakannya. Orang
yang menganggap zakat bukan rukun Islam  maka ia dapat dianggap kafir dan orang
yang tidak berzakat padahal telah diwajibkan maka ia telah melakukan perbuatan
dosa karena telah menolak perintah Allah dan telah mengabaikan hak para mustahiq.
Oleh karena itu  penunaian zakat bukan sekedar untuk menggugurkan kewajiban tapi
berdampak positif kepada kehidupan sosial karena keberadaannya dapat
mensejahterakan kehidupan bagi orang yang tidak mampu.
Ide untuk mengembangkan zakat sebagai modal usaha muncul ketika fokus
perhatian dilakukan secara seksama bahwa para fuqara dan masakin tidak semuanya
orang-orang yang memiliki keterbatasan kekuatan fisik. Di antara mereka terdapat
banyak yang memiliki kesehatan fisik dan keahlian yang dapat dikembangkan  tapi
mereka tidak memiliki modal. Sehingga keluar ide untuk memberikan zakat kepada
mereka untuk bisa dijadikan sebagai modal usaha yang dapat meningkatkan status
21

ekonominya dan sekaligus mengembangkan keahlian yang mereka miliki. Maka
pihak yang paling berperan dalam zakat produktif ini adalah kreatifitas mustahiq
untuk menjadikan zakat sebagai modal yang terus dikembangkan.
2. Prospek Zakat Produktif
Prospek ke depan  zakat yang diperoleh dari hasil usaha ini memiliki peluang
yang cerah jika pengelolaannya dilakukan secara baik dan profesional. Pengelolaan
itu dapat dilakukan melalui pengembangan sumber daya mustahiq yang potensial
yang jumlahnya cukup banyak. Lain halnya ketika menghadapi mustahiq zakat yang
konsumtif  yaitu yang tidak memiliki kemampuan dan keahlian untuk
mengembangkan zakat seperti orang jompo  anak yatim yang masih kecil  orang
dewasa yang cacat atau sakit berat maka zakat untuk mereka ini hanya untuk
membantu kelangsungan hidup mereka karena mereka lebih banyak bersifat pasif.
Bagi mustahiq zakat yang produktif atau disebut mustahiq aktif  mereka masih
berumur produktif dan memiliki badan yang sehat  maka selayaknya bagi mereka
zakat dapat disalurkan secara produktif yaitu dengan menjadikan zakat sebagai
modal usaha. Oleh karena itu diperlukan sikap proaktif dari mustahiq untuk
mencurahkan kemampuannya dalam pengembangan modal dari zakat itu.
Menurut hemat penulis  usaha pengembangan zakat menjadi modal usaha
memerlukan sumber daya manusia (SDM) yang cukup handal. Oleh karena itu
diperlukan upaya untuk meningkatkan SDM (sumber daya manusia) mustahiq
dengan mengadakan pelatihan atau training yang dapat dilakukan oleh badan 
seperti bazis atau pemerintah  sehingga mereka benar-benar memiliki keahlian yang
mapan untuk dapat mengembangkan modal usaha yang didapat dari zakat tersebut.
Selain itu di masyarakat terdapat banyak keahlian yang dimiliki oleh mereka yang
tergolong mustahiq yang tampaknya diperoleh tanpa melalui latihan khusus seperti
pedagang kaki lima  sopir  pengrajin tangan  tukang kuli batu  dan lain sebagainya.
Jika penyaluran zakat dilakukan dengan baik serta penggunaannya terbilang optimal 
maka hal ini akan dapat meningkatkan taraf ekonomi mereka yang tergolong lemah
untuk selanjutnya diharapkan kehidupan mereka tidak bergantung kepada zakat.
22

Untuk mereka  zakat hanya modal pertama saja selanjutnya mereka tidak lagi sebagai
mustahiq zakat  tapi menjadi orang yang wajib mengeluarkan zakat (muzakki).
Uraian di atas memperlihatkan bahwa sesungguhnya keberadaan zakat
produktif itu dapat dibenarkan. Pemberian modal kepada mustahiq zakat sebagai
modal usaha berarti memberikan perhatian kepada para mustahiq untuk hidup lebih
layak  hal ini merupakan ajaran Islam seperti diperkuat oleh al-Quran:
L!N 'NJPF:R N #LDO GP 'NN DR 'LLEO GO O(L3N -R JN L6P 1R N D#R 'LJPAL'K(1R 6N LFN HO9J7P N*3R NJLD'N LP'DDQNQN LDP JP(3N LJPAL'H1O 5P -R O #LFN J0P QN D'L!P '1N NBOADR DP
LE JDP9N LGP LP(LN'DDQNQN LFQN P%NAL1M JR .N LFR EP L'HOBAP FRO*L'EN HN L'KA'-N DR P%L3N 'QNFD'LFN HODN #3R NJLD'N LER GO 'EN J3P P(LER GO OA1P 9R N*LAP QOAN9QN*D'LFN EP
Artinya: Berinfaklah untuk orang-orang faqir yang terikat oleh jihad di jalan Allah 
mereka tidak mampu berusaha di bumi. Orang yang tidak tahu  menyangka mereka adalah
orang yang kaya karena memelihara diri dari meminta-minta. Kamu melihat mereka
dengan melihat sifat-sifatnya. Mereka tidak meminta-minta kepada orang secara
mendesak. Dan apa yang kamu nafkahkan di jalan Allah  sesungguhnya Allah Maha
Mengetahui. (QS. al-Baqarah: 273)
Arif Mufraini dalam Buku Akuntansi dan Manajemen Zakat (2006:147) telah
mengemas bentuk inovasi pendistribusian zakat yang dikategorikan dalam empat
bentuk: Pertama  distribusi bersifat konsumtif tradisional  yaitu zakat dibagikan
kepada mustahik untuk dimanfaatkan secara langsung  seperti zakat fitrah  atau zakat
mal yang dibagikan kepada para korban bencana alam. Kedua  distribusi bersifat
konsumtif kreatif. yaitu zakat yang diwujudkan dalam bentuk lain dari barangnya
semula  seperti diberikan dalam bentuk alat-alat sekolah atau beasiswa. Ketiga 
distribusi bersifat produktif tradisional  yaitu zakat diberikan dalam bentuk
barang-barang yang produktif seperti kambing  sapi  dan lain sebagainya. Pemberian
dalam bentuk ini dapat menciptakan usaha yang membuka lapangan kerja bagi fakir
miskin. Keempat  distribusi dalam bentuk produktif kreatif  yaitu zakat
diwujudkan dalam bentuk permodalan baik untuk menambah modal pedagang
pengusaha kecil ataupun membangun proyek sosial dan proyek ekonomis.
Dengan demikian  zakat produktif adalah zakat yang didistribusikan kepada
mustahik  yang dikelola dan dikembangkan melalui perilaku-perilaku bisnis.
Indikasinya adalah harta zakat dimanfaatkan sebagai modal yang diharapkan dapat
meningkatkan taraf ekonomi mustahik. Termasuk juga dalam pengertian zakat
23

produktif jika harta zakat dikelola dan dikembangkan oleh amil yang hasilnya
disalurkan kepada mustahik secara berkala. Lebih tegasnya zakat produktif adalah
zakat yang disalurkan kepada mustahik dengan cara yang tepat guna  efektif
manfaatnya dengan sistem yang serba guna dan produktif  sesuai dengan pesan
syariat dan peran serta fungsi sosial ekonomis dari zakat.
Hikmah yang dapat dipetik dari praktek zakat produktif diantaranya agar
terjadi komunikasi yang dapat menghilangkan menara gading antara si miskin
dengan si kaya. Efek yang ditimbulkannya menjadikan si muzakki (pemberi zakat)
akan merasa puas dan senang karena zakatnya bisa berkembang; di sisi lain
menjadikan mustahiq tidak menjadi mental pengemis dan tersalurkan
kemampuannya. Dengan demikian terjadi hubungan yang signifikan antara
keberadaan zakat produktif dengan peningkatan sumber daya manusia. Dan yang
terpenting lagi  dengan zakat produktif tidak terjadi sikap pembiaran terhadap fakir
miskin dan menjadikannya cara untuk menyelamatkan mustahik dari bahaya
kefakiran yang dapat menjadikan seorang menjadi kafir  sebagaimana diperkuat oleh
Hadits Nabi:
'1K AR CO LFN HR CO NJLFR N #L1O BR NADR'LN/'CN
Artinya: Kefakiran (kemiskinan) berakibat kepada kekafiran.
Dengan demikian  zakat produktif ini memiliki hikmah syari yang serupa
dengan hikmah zakat yaitu mensejahterakan kehidupan mustahik. Dengan zakat
produktif  status mustahik mampu berubah menjadi muzakki dengan potensi yang
dimilikinya; mustahik akan mampu memberdayakan dana zakat yang diterimanya
sebagai modal usaha yang pada akhirnya  ia pun akan menjadi pengusaha yang
sukses.
D. PENYALURAN ZAKAT UNTUK PEMBANGUNAN MASJID
Penjelasan tentang kelompok orang yang berhak menerima sudah cukup jelas
diinformasikan oleh al-Quran. Secara tekstual istilah masjid tidak terdapat dalam
kelompok yang delapan tersebut. inilah yang menimbulkan permasalahan apakah
zakat dapat disalurkan untuk pembangunan dan pemugaran masjid. Uraian berikut
24

mencoba untuk menjelaskan hukum penyaluran kepada sesuatu yang diluar asnaf
(kelompok mustahiq zakat tersebut).
1. Kelompok Mustahiq Zakat
Jumhur ulama sepakat bahwa kelompok mustahiq zakat itu terdiri delapan
asnaf atau bagian. Kesepakatan tersebut didasari oleh ayat al-Quran surat al-Taubat
ayat 60 sebagai berikut:
LFN JEP 1P 'N:DR 'LHN L(P 'NBL1 P D'LJPAHN LER GO O(HODOBL)P NAQN D$N EO DR 'HN L'GN JR DN 9N LFN JDPEP 'N9DR 'HN LFP JCP '3N EN DR 'HN L!P '1N NBOADR DPL*O 'NBN/5QN D'L'EN QNFP%
LE JCP -N LE JDP9N LO'DDQNQN HN LP'DDQNQN LFN EP LK )6N J1P NALDP JP(3QN D'LFP (R P'HN LP'DDQNQN LDP J(P 3N LJPAHN
Artinya: Shadaqah adalah hak untuk fakir  miskin  amil zakat  muallaf  budak  orang yang
terlilit hutang  di jalan Allah  dan orang yang dalam perjalanan (musafir). Sebagai
kewajiban yang datang dari Allah dan Allah Maha Mengetahui dan Maha Bijaksana.
(QS. at-Taubah: 60)
Delapan kelompok (mustahiq) zakat sebagaimana tercantum dalam ayat di atas 
penjelasannya sebagai berikut. Fuqara  yaitu Orang yang tidak memiliki harta dan
pekerjaan yang dapat memenuhi kebutuhannya sehari-hari. Orang yang termasuk
kelompok ini tidak memiliki suami (isteri)  ayah  ibu  dan anak yang dapat memenuhi
kebutuhan hidupnya. Masakin  yaitu Orang yang memiliki pekerjaan  tapi hasilnya
tidak dapat memenuhi kebutuhannya  Amilin yaitu Yaitu orang yang bekerja
memungut zakat (panitia zakat). Muallaf  pengertiannya dapat berarti orang yang
baru masuk Islam sedangkan imannya masih lemah  maka untuk menguatkannya
perlu diyakinkan dengan zakat. Atau orang kafir yang berniat untuk masuk Islam 
tapi masih tipis keimanannya  maka ia dapat diberi zakat supaya niat masuk Islamnya
menjadi kuat. Budak  yaitu orang yang hidupnya tidak merdeka  dikuasai oleh
tuannya dan berniat untuk membebaskan dirinya Orang yang terlilit hutang  yaitu
orang yang memiliki tunggakan hutang kepada orang lain baik hutang tersebut
untuk kepentingan pribadinya atau hutang karena untuk biaya kebajikan. Orang
yang berjuang di jalan Allah  yaitu para tentara yang berperang melawan serangan
orang kafir. Orang yang sedang dalam perjalanan. Yaitu orang yang sedang
melakukan sebuah perjalanan dengan tujuan yang baik bukan untuk kemaksiatan 
seperti pelajar atau mahasiswa yang belajar di luar negeri.
25

2. Hukum Zakat untuk Pembangunan Masjid
Seperti terungkap di muka  permasalahan yang muncul adalah  apa hukum
zakat untuk pembangunan masjid? Sebab dalam surat at-Taubah ayat 60 
sebagaimana dijelaskan di atas  pembangunan dan pemugaran mesjid tidak termasuk
ke dalam mustahiq zakat. Oleh karena itu  untuk menjawab pertanyaan di atas
diperlukan ijtihad yang dapat menentukan pintu masuk kepada kelompok mana
zakat untuk pembangunan masjid itu?
Di antara kedelapan macam mustahiq zakat seperti tersebut di atas  terdapat
mustahiq yang disebut sabilillah yang secara bahasa artinya jalan Allah. Para ulama
dalam memahami kata sabilillah tidak hanya terbatas pada makna hakiki yaitu para
pejuang yang berperang menegakkan agama Allah tapi memahaminya juga dari
makna majazi yang bersifat umum. Terkait dengan makna yang terakhir ini  para
ulama memiliki penafsiran yang beraneka ragam.
Menurut Mahmud Syaltut  istilah sabilillah memiliki arti kemaslahatan umat
yang manfaatnya kembali kepada kaum muslimin seperti pembangunan mesjid 
rumah sakit  perlengkapan pendidikan  dan sebagainya. Memperkuat pendapatnya 
Syaltut mengutip pendapat Imam Al-Razi yang mengatakan bahwa kata sabilillah
tidak terbatas pada arti tentara. Syaltut juga mengutip pendapat al-Qaffal yang
berpendapat bahwa boleh menyalurkan zakat ke semua bentuk kebaikan seperti
untuk mengurus mayat  membangun benteng  dan pembangunan masjid. Tetapi
Syaltut memberikan catatan bahwa zakat yang diperbolehkan untuk pembangunan
masjid dengan syarat masjid itu hanya satu-satunya di suatu desa  atau untuk
pembangunan masjid baru karena mesjid yang tersedia tidak cukup lagi untuk
menampung jamaah. Menurut Syaltut  arti sabilillah dapat disimpulkan menyangkut
pemeliharaan posisi materi dan spiritual suatu bangsa termasuk di dalamnya masjid.
Menurut al-Maraghi  istilah sabilillah adalah semua perkara yang berhubungan
dengan kemaslahatan ummat dapat dimasukkan ke dalam sabilillah  seperti perkara
yang menyangkut masalah agama dan pemerintahan  seperti masalah pelayanan haji.
26

M. Rasyid Ridha berpendapat bahwa  istilah sabilillah mencakup semua
kepentingan syariah secara umum yang berkenaan dengan masalah agama dan
negara dan yang terpenting  untuk persiapan kepentingan perang dengan membeli
persenjataan.
Menurut Yusuf Qardhawi  istilah sabilillah memiliki arti yang lentur  yaitu
semua sarana yang dapat dipergunakan untuk memperjuangkan kemajuan ummat
Islam dan melawan semua bentuk serangan orang-orang kafir  semuanya termasuk
sabilillah. Lebih rinci  beliau menyebutkan usaha pembebasan Islam dari kekuasaan
dengan memerangi kaum kafir  sarana pendidikan dan pengajaran serta lembaga
dakwah  surat kabar islami  penerbitan buku-buku islami dan para dai  semua yang
disebutkan di atas dapat dimasukkan ke dalam cakupan makna sabilillah.
Sayyid Sabiq berpendapat  bahwa istilah sabilillah adalah semua jalan yang
dapat menyampaikan kepada keridhaan Allah  baik berupa ilmu atau amal.
Mencermati pendapat-pendapat di atas  maka dapatlah disimpulkan bahwa
pengertian sabilillah secara umum dapat mencakup semua jalan kebaikan yang
manfaatnya kembali kepada umat Islam termasuk di dalamya adalah masjid 
penyebutan sarana ibadah yang disebutkan terakhir ini secara jelas disebut oleh
Mahmud Syaltut pada point pertama. Pengertian mazaj semacam ini dalam hukum
Islam dapat ditolerir selama tidak bertentangan dengan kaidah agama. Keberadaan
masjid dalam masyarakat memiliki peranan strategis  fungsinya bukan hanya sebagai
tempat sholat  tapi dapat dijadikan pusat pendidikan  dakwah  serta sosial
kemasyarakatan dalam rangka menegakkan agama Allah swt. Dengan demikian 
zakat boleh disalurkan untuk pembangunan masjid karena mesjid termasuk sabilillah
yang mengandung manfaat bagi umat Islam.
Selanjutnya menurut penulis  skala prioritas harus diutamakan. Terlebih
sekarang ini  keberadaan masjid di masyarakat begitu banyak dan pesat  sehingga
jarak masjid sangat berdekatan dan relatif jamaahnya di beberapa masjid ditemukan
sangat sedikit. Mengingat hal itu  penulis sejalan dengan Mahmud Syaltut yang
berpendapat bahwa penyaluran zakat untuk masjid itu harus diutamakan untuk
masjid baru yang dibangun karena masjid yang berdekatan sudah tidak mampu lagi
27

untuk menampung jamaah atau untuk agenda perluasan masjid karena daya
tampungnya tidak lagi mencukupi untuk menampung jamaah.
Terdapat fatwa MUI Nomor 001 Tahun 2015 tentang pendayagunaan dana
zakat  infaq  shadaqah dan wakaf untuk pengadaan sarana yang bermanfaat dan
mendesak untuk kemaslahatan masyarakat seperti sarana air bersih dan sanitasi.
Fatwa tersebut merupakan produk hukum baru terkait pendistribusian dana zakat.
Hal ini berlandaskan pengambilan maslahah demi kepentingan umat dan menghindari
kemudharatan yang telah terjadi di berbagai daerah. Tujuan utama kehadiran hukum
syari agar dijadikan pedoman utama dalam kehidupannya tidak lain agar manusia
meraih kebaikan (maslahah)  atau dengan kata lain untuk mewujudkan kemaslahatan
umat.
Contoh Soal
Zakat profesi merupakan zakat yang diwajibkan kepada umat islam. Sebab Islam
mengajarkan kepada umat manusia akan kesadaran bahwa harta ini hanya titipan dan
karunia dari Allah swt. Berikut ini pernyataan yang mendukung kewajiban zakat profesi
adalah
1. Zaman dahulu profesi hanya terbatas pada profesi perdagangan  pertanian  emas dan
perak  sehingga kewajiban harta terbatas pada profesi-profesi tersebut  sedangkan
zaman modern hari ini  pertanian sudah banyak ditinggalkan  orang lebih banyak
berprofesi sebagai pegawai dengan keahlian masing-masing. Ada yang insinyur 
dokter  guru dan lain sebagainya. Mereka pun mendapatkan rizki dari profesi yang
dilakukannya  maka mereka pun tetap punya kewajiban terhadap harta tersebut.
2. Pertanian  perdagangan  emas  perak merupakan profesi yang bernilai tinggi 
sedangkan profesi yang berkembang hari ini  hanya profesi yang bernilai rendah 
bahkan penghasilan profesinya banyak penipuan yang dilakukannya  sehingga tidak
ada kewajiban untuk membayarkan zakatnya.
3. Zakat itu untuk membersihkan jiwa dan harta. Dari mana pun harta yang kita hasilkan
hakikatnya adalah dari Allah swt. Untuk bisa membersihkan jiwa dan harta ini  maka
cara yang diajarkan oleh agama adalah mengeluarkan zakatnya.
28

4. Harta yang dikeluarkan untuk zakat haruslah yang bersih dan halal  sebab ia akan
menjadi pembersih  jika kotor yang digunakannya maka akan menjadi kotor badan
dan hartanya. Profesi di dunia modern ini banyak kotornya  dia banyak menipu
orang  banyak kezaliman kepada orang jadi tidak perlu ada kewajiban zakat profesi.
5. Manusia adalah makhluk sosial. Semua harta dan penghasilan yang diterima memuat
Sebagian kecil hak orang lain yang harus disalurkan. Zakat adalah salah satu cara
untuk membersihkan harta yang dimiliki dengan cara menyalurkannya kepada
mereka yang berhak menerimanya.
Diantara pernyataan yang mendukung kewajiban zakat profesi adalah&
A. 1  2 dan 3 D. 1  3 dan 5
B. 2  3 dan 4 E. 2  4 dan 5
C. 3  4 dan 5

A. Konsep Nikah dalam Islam
1. Syariat Pernikahan
Kedudukan nikah dalam Islam merupakan syariat yang terkandung didalamnya
nilai-nilai ibadah. Kelayakan manusia untuk menerima syariat tersebut paling tidak
diperkuat oleh tiga argumen. Pertama  manusia adalah makhluk berakal dan dengan akalnya
tersebut manusia mampu menerima dan menjalankan syariat dengan baik. Di antara syariat
tersebut adalah pernikahan  yang pengertiannya menurut ulama Syafiiyah  sebagai berikut:
 JH2*D'LH'L-'CFD%'L8AD(L!7HD'L)-'(%LFE6*JL/B9
(Akad (perjanjian) yang mengandung kebolehan hubungan kelamin dengan sebab lafaz nikah
atau tajwiz).
Kedua  manusia diciptakan oleh Allah berpasangan  yaitu laki-laki dan perempuan
sebagaimana dijelaskan oleh Allah swt:
LFN HEO DN 9R NJLD'N L'EQN EP HN LER GP 3P OAFRN #LFR EP HN L6O 1R N D#R 'L*O P(FRO*L'EQN EP L'GN QN DCO L N 'HN 2R N D#R 'LBN ND.N LJ0P QN D'LFN '-N (R 3O
Artinya: Maha Suci Tuhan yang telah menciptakan pasangan-pasangan semuanya  baik dari
apa yang ditumbuhkan oleh bumi dan dari diri mereka maupun dari apa yang tidak mereka
ketahui. (QS. Yasin: 36)
Dari kehidupan berpasangan  manusia disyariatkan untuk menjalin hubungan yang
mulia  mengembangkan keturunan  menegaskan hak dan kewajiban antara keduanya. Untuk
itu Allah menurunkan syariat yang bertujuan menjaga harkat dan martabat serta kehormatan
manusia yang disebut dengan nikah.
Ketiga  pernikahan dalam Islam disebut sebagai perilaku para Nabi dan
memasukkannya sebagai salah satu fitrah yang dimiliki oleh manusia. Rasulullah saw
bersabda empat fitrah yang dimiliki oleh manusia  yaitu memakai pacar  wangi-wangian 
bersiwak (gosok gigi)  dan nikah. (al-Hadis)
Untuk dijadikan sebuah perbandingan  sebelum pembahasan nikah menurut Islam
secara lebih mendalam perlu diungkap tentang pernikahan sebelum Islam (Jahiliyah). Pada
zaman Jahiliyah telah dikenal beberapa praktek perkawinan yang merupakan warisan turun
temurun dari perkawinan Romawi dan Persia. Pertama  perkawinan pacaran (khidn)  yaitu
berupa pergaulan bebas pria dan wanita sebelum perkawinan yang resmi dilangsungkan
33

yang tujuannya untuk mengetahui kepribadian masing-masing pasangan. Kedua  nikah badl 
yaitu seorang suami minta kepada laki-laki lain untuk saling menukar istrinya. Ketiga  nikah
istibdha  yaitu seorang suami minta kepada laki-laki kaya  bangsawan atau orang pandai agar
bersedia mengumpuli istrinya yang dalam keadaan suci sampai ia hamil. Setelah itu baru si
suami mengumpulinya. Keempat  nikah Raht (urunan)  seorang wanita dikumpuli oleh
beberapa pria sampai hamil. Ketika anaknya lahir  lalu wanita itu menunjuk salah satu pria
yang telah mengumpulinya untuk mengakui bayi yang telah dilahirkannya sebagai anaknya.
Nikah ini sama dengan nikah baghaaya (nikah pelacur).
Kehadiran Islam menghapus semua bentuk pernikahan di atas karena dipandang
tidak sejalan dengan naluriah dan kehormatan manusia serta dapat dikatakan cara binatang
yang tidak mengenal aturan. Nikah dalam syariat Islam diartikan sebagai sebuah akad yang
menghalalkan pergaulan dan membatasi hak dan kewajiban serta tolong menolong antara
laki-laki dan perempuan yang bukan mahramnya dengan rukun dan syarat yang telah
ditentukan. Al-Quran menyebut nikah sebagai mitsaq (perjanjian) antara suami dan isteri
sejak terjadinya akad. Hal ini dipahami karena keduanya berjanji untuk menjalankan hak dan
kewajiban masing-masing dengan sebaik-baiknya.
'8K JDP:N L'KB'N+JEP LER CO FR EP LFN 0R .N N #HN L6M 9R (N LINDP%LER CO 6O 9R (N LI6N AR N #L/R NBHN LOGNFHO0.O R #N*LAN JR CN HN
Artinya: Bagaimana kamu akan mengambilnya kembali  padahal sebagian kamu telah bergaul
(bercampur) dengan yang lain sebagai suami-isteri. Dan mereka (isteri-isterimu) telah mengambil
dari kamu perjanjian yang kuat. (QS. An-Nisa: 21)
Sepasang calon suami istri yang ingin melangsungkan ikatan pernikahan diharuskan
untuk memenuhi syarat dan rukun nikah. Terkait dengan rukun nikah  para ulama sepakat 
terdapat lima hal yang menjadi rukun nikah. calon suami istri  Wali dari calon isteri  dua
orang saksi  Mahar (mas kawin)  dan Ijab-qabul.
2. Hikmah atau Tujuan Nikah
Setiap syariat yang diturunkan oleh Allah dipastikan terdapat hikmah untuk
kehidupan manusia. Sedikitnya terdapat lima point penting yang penulis kutip dari
pendapat Sayyid Sabiq dalam kitabnya Fiqh Sunnah berkaitan dengan hikmah dari sebuah
pernikahan.
a. Nafsu seks termasuk tuntutan terkuat dan selalu meliputi kehidupan manusia. Ketika
tidak ada jalan keluar untuk melampiaskan  maka manusia akan dirundung
34

kegelisahan dan dikhawatirkan melakukan prostitusi (perzinahan). Maka pernikahan
merupakan aturan yang paling baik dan jalan keluar yang menyejukkan untuk
memuaskan seks manusia. Dengan nikah jasad menjadi segar  jiwa menjadi tentram
dan penglihatan akan menutupi sesuatu yang diharamkan. Ini semua terkandung dari
petunjuk Allah dalam firmanNya:

di antaramu rasa kasih dan sayang. Sesungguhnya pada yang demikian itu benar-benar terdapat
tanda-tanda bagi kaum yang berfikir. (QS. ar-Rum: 21)
b. Pernikahan jalan terbaik untuk melahirkan anak  memperbanyak kelahiran dan
melestarikan kehidupan dengan selalu menjaga keturunan.
c. Naluri kebapakan dan keibuan akan tumbuh dan berkembang dalam menaungi anak
masa kanak-kanak serta tumbuhnya rasa kasih-sayang. Semua kelebihan itu tidak
akan sempurna tanpa adanya tali pernikahan.
d. Rasa tanggung jawab dari pernikahan serta mengurus anak dapat membangkitkan
semangat dan mencurahkan segala kemampuan dalam memperkuat potensi diri.
Maka bangkitlah untuk bekerja dengan segala kewajiban sehingga banyak kesibukan
yang dapat menambah harta  kesuksesan dan tergugah semangat untuk
mengeluarkan kekayaan alam dan yang terpendam di dalamnya.
e. Membagi-bagi pekerjaan dan membatasi tanggung jawab pekerjaan kepada suami
dan isteri. Isteri mengurus rumah  hingga tertata dengan rapih  mendidik anak dan
mempersiapkan udara segar untuk suami agar dapat beristirahat yang dapat
menghilangkan kelelahannya dan menimbulkan semangat baru yang dapat
membangkitkan semangat kerja untuk memperoleh harta dan nafkah yang
dibutuhkan. Pembagian kerja yang adil terhadap suami istri sesuai dengan tugas
alamiah mereka masing-masing ini akan diridhai oleh Allah dan pujian manusia serta
menghasilkan buah yang diberkahi.

3. Hukum Pernikahan
Penetapan hukum nikah termasuk perkara yang selalu dikaitkan dengan kondisi
orang yang akan melakukannya. Dengan demikian kondisi tersebut dapat dijadikan sebagai
illat hukumnya. Hal yang dapat dimaklumi bahwa kondisi seseorang itu berbeda antara
yang satu dengan yang lainnya jika dilihat dari aspek gejolak seks dan kemampuan
pemberian nafkah. Berangkat dari perbedaan kondisi tersebut maka para ulama
menghukumi nikah itu sesuai dengan illat (sebab) yang ditemui dari seseorang yang akan
melangsungkan pernikahan. Memperhatikan berbagai macam illat nikah maka hukum nikah
dapat ditetapkan sebagai berikut:
a. Wajib  hukum ini layak dibebankan kepada orang yang telah mampu memberi nafkah 
jiwanya terpanggil untuk nikah dan jika tidak nikah khawatir terjerumus ke lembah
perzinahan. Hal ini diperkuat oleh tuntunan agama bahwa menjaga diri dari perbuatan
haram adalah wajib. Sedangkan bagi yang hanya memiliki keinginan yang kuat tapi
belum mampu memberi nafkah  maka lebih baik ia menahan diri. Hal ini didasari oleh
firman Allah swt:
LGP DP6R NALFR EP LO'DDQNLQN LEO GO NJFP :R OJLIQN*-N L'-K 'CN FP LFN HO/NP NJLD'N LFN J0P QN D'LAP AP 9R N*3R NJDR HN
Artinya: Dan orang-orang yang tidak mampu kawin hendaklah menjaga kesucian (diri) nya 
sehingga Allah memampukan mereka dengan karunia-Nya. (QS. An-Nuur: 33)
Salah satu cara untuk menjaga diri ketika gejolak nafsu biologis yang memuncak bagi
orang yang belum layak nikah karena belum mampu menafkahi seperti tersebut di atas.
disarankan agar ia memperbanyak puasa. Hal ini diperkuat oleh Hadits Rasulullah saw
berikut ini:
L P 1R NADR DPLFO 5N -R N'HN L1P 5N N(DR DPL6QO :N N #LOGQNF'P NAL R HQN 2N NL*NJDRNALN)!N 'N(DR'LEO CO FR EP L9N '7N N*3R 'LFP EN L(P 'N(4QN D'L1N 4N 9R EN L'NJ
(I1'.(D'LG'H1)L! ' N HP LOGNDLOGQNF'P NALEP HR 5QN D'P(LGP JR NDN9AN L9R 7P N*3R NJLER NDLFR EN HN
Artinya: Hai para pemuda  siapa diantara kalian yang sudah mampu untuk menikah  maka
menikahlah  karena nikah dapat menahan pandangan dari maksiat dan dapat menjaga
kemaluan dari berbuat zina. Namun bagi siapa yang belum mampu hendaklah ia berpuasa
karena puasa dapat membentengi dorongan sahwat. (HR. Bukhari)
36

b. Sunah  hukum ini pantas bagi orang yang merindukan pernikahan dan mampu memberi
nafkah tapi sebenarnya ia masih mampu menahan dirinya dari perbuatan zina. Maka
bagi orang seperti ini hukum nikah menjadi sunah. Akan tetapi jika demikian kondisinya 
nikah lebih baik baginya dari pada membujang karena dalam nikah terdapat ibadah yang
banyak. Sedangkan membujang (tidak nikah) itu seperti para pendeta Nasrani yang
dilarang oleh Rasulullah.
I1N '5N QNFD'L)P QNJFP 'N(GR 1O CN L'HR OFHR CO N*LND'HN LEO EN OD'R'LEO CO (P L1 +'P CN EO LI PF'P NAL'HR  O HQN 2N N*
Artinya: Nikahlah kamu sekalian karena aku akan berbanyak-banyak umat pada hari Qiamat
dan janganlah kamu seperti pendeta Nasrani.
Memperkuat anjuran nikah  Umar pernah berkata kepada Abi Zawaid  hanya sifat lemah
atau melacurlah yang mencegahmu dari nikah. Berkata juga Ibnu Abbas bahwa tidak
akan sempurna ibadah seseorang sampai ia menikah.
c. Haram  hukum ini layak bagi orang yang tidak mampu memberikan nafkah dan jika ia
memaksakan diri untuk menikah akan mengkhianati isterinya atau suaminya  baik
dalam pemberian nafkah lahiriyah maupun batiniyah  sehingga dengan perkawinan itu
hak-hak istri/suami tidak terpenuhi.
B. Pernikahan Monogami dalam Ajaran Islam
1. Pengertian Monogami
Dalam kamus bahasa Indonesia  monogami berarti sistem yang hanya
memperbolehkan seorang laki-laki mempunyai satu isteri pada jangka waktu tertentu. Dari
tarif atau definisi tersebut dapat dipahami bahwa seorang suami yang beristerikan satu isteri
saja tidak dua atau tiga maka suami itu menganut monogami.
Asas monogami telah ditetapkan oleh Islam sejak lima belas abad yang lalu sebagai
salah satu asas perkawinan dalam Islam. Tujuannya untuk memberikan landasan dan modal
utama dalam pembinaan kehidupan rumah tangga yang harmonis  sejahtera dan bahagia.
Oleh karena itu hukum asal perkawinan dalam Islam adalah monogami. Hukum ini sangatlah
beralasan karena dengan monogami tujuan pernikahan untuk menghantarkan keluarga
bahagia akan lebih mudah karena tidak terlalu banyak beban. Selain dengan bermonogami
juga akan lebih mudah untuk menetralisir dan meredam sifat cemburu  iri hati dan perasaan
mengeluh dalam kehidupan isteri sehari-hari. Islam memerintahkan kepada laki-laki untuk
37

nikah dengan seorang perempuan yang dicintainya. Bagi laki-laki  selayaknya sikap
monogami ini jika tidak ada alasan yang dapat dibenarkan untuk beristeri lebih dari satu 
seperti si isteri ternyata mandul.
2. Dalil dan Hukum Asal Pernikahan Monogami
Pada asalnya hukum Islam menetapkan kepada laki-laki untuk beristeri satu saja.
Isyarat al-Quran untuk bermonogami bagi laki-laki dapat kita pahami dari berbagai ayat al-
Quran yang memerintahkan kepada laki-laki untuk menikah jika sudah mampu  sikap
membujang berkepanjangan tanpa alasan adalah sikap yang tidak dibenarkan karena dalam
nikah banyak terdapat kebaikan. Hal ini dapat dilihat dalam al-Quran antara lain:
LGP DP6R NALLFR EP LO'DDQNLQN LEO GP PF:R OJL!N '1N NBOAL'HOFHCO JN LFR P%LER CO P&'EN %P HN LER CO /P 'N(9P LFR EP LFN J-P DP'5QN D'HN LER CO FR EP LIEN 'NJN D#R 'L'H-O CP FRN #HN
LE JDP9N L9 3P 'HN LO'DDQNQN HN
Artinya: Dan kawinkanlah orang-orang yang sendirian di antara kamu  dan orang-orang yang
layak (berkawin) dari hamba-hamba sahayamu yang lelaki dan hamba-hamba sahayamu yang
perempuan. Jika mereka miskin Allah akan memampukan mereka dengan kurnia-Nya. Dan Allah
Maha Luas (pemberian-Nya) Lagi Maha Mengetahui. (QS. An-Nur 32).
Adapun dasar hukum monogami dalam Islam adalah al-Quran yang menjelaskan
tentang kewajiban berperilaku adil terhadap seorang istri  dan jika khawatir tidak mampu
berperilaku adil maka wajib monogami. Bahkan secara tegas bahwa Allah menyatakan bahwa
para suami tidak akan mampu berbuat adil kepada istri mereka. Hal ini sebagaimana
dijelaskan dalam firman Allah swt berikut ini:

atau budak-budak yang kamu miliki. Yang demikian itu adalah lebih dekat kepada tidak berbuat
aniaya [Q.S. an-Nisa: 3).

memelihara diri (dari kecurangan) maka sesungguhnya Allah Maha Pengampun lagi Maha
Penyayang. [Q.S. an-Nisa (4): 129].
Menurut Yusuf Qardhawi  Islam adalah agama yang sejalan dengan fitrah manusia;
mengakui fakta yang dapat membimbing dan menjauhkan manusia dari perbuatan bodoh.
Sebelum Islam datang  agama-agama terdahulu telah membolehkan praktek poligami sampai
seratus isteri tanpa terikat oleh syarat dan aturan. Itulah kultur yang terjadi di masyarakat
dahulu. Islam datang tidak menghapus secara serta merta sistem poligami Jahiliyah  yang
sudah mendarah daging namun membangun aturan poligami; penerapan pembatasan
jumlah istri tidak boleh lebih dari empat di samping adanya syarat-syarat lain yang
berhubungan dengan keadilan.
Islam turun di tengah-tengah masyarakat jahiliyah dalam kondisi poligami yang
berlebihan dan agar Islam diterima oleh mereka pada saat itu  maka Islam membolehkan
praktik menikah dengan batasan empat orang istri. Dengan demikian  hukum asal
pernikahan dalam Islam adalah monogami. Sebab syarat keadilan menjadi syarat berat bagi
setiap suami yang akan melaksanakan pernikahan lebih dari seorang istri.
C. Poligami dalam Ajaran Islam
1. Pengertian dan Hukum Poligami
Secara kebahasaan yang lebih tepat adalah poligini yang dalam kamus bahasa
Indonesia diartikan sebagai Sistem perkawinan yang membolehkan seorang pria memiliki
beberapa wanita sebagai isterinya di waktu yang bersamaan. Namun dalam tulisan ini 
selanjutnya penulis cenderung untuk menggunakan istilah poligami untuk pembahasan
dimaksud  yaitu poligami yang bermakna pologini (suami beristeri lebih dari satu) karena
selain bisa dibenarkan secara kebahasaan juga istilah tersebut sudah populer penyebutannya
di masyarakat untuk laki-laki yang beristeri lebih dari satu.
Di masyarakat seperti sekarang ini  sikap berpoligami bagi sebagian laki-laki seakan
menjadi sesuatu yang dianggap mudah untuk dilakukan karena hanya semata mengikuti
nafsu biologis dan tidak mengikuti aturan yang sebenarnya. Memang Pada asalnya hukum
poligami itu diperbolehkan jika seseorang suami tidak dikhawatirkan berbuat zhalim
terhadap isteri-isterinya. Jika dipastikan akan berlaku zhalim  maka seorang suami lebih baik
untuk beristeri satu saja.
39

Islam diperuntukan untuk semua jenis dan golongan manusia serta memelihara
kepentingan dan kemashlahatan yang bersifat pribadi dan umum. Kebolehan poligami untuk
mewujudkan kemashlahatan bagi manusia agar tidak berlaku zina dan tidak terjatuh ke dalam
pintu kemaksiatan. Dengan kata lain menurut Mahmud Syaltut  bahwa pada asalnya Islam
memerintahkan laki-laki untuk beristeri satu  boleh beristeri lebih dari satu jika dipandang
darurat.
Yusuf Qardhawi menjelaskan kondisi darurat yang dengannya seorang laki-laki
dibolehkan berpoligami adalah sebagai berikut: pertama  ditemukan seorang suami yang
menginginkan keturunan  akan tetapi ternyata isterinya tidak dapat melahirkan anak
disebabkan karena mandul atau penyakit. Kedua  Di antara suami ada yang memiliki
overseks  akan tetapi isterinya memiliki kelemahan seks  memiliki penyakit atau masa
haidhnya terlalu panjang sedangkan suaminya tidak sabar menghadapi kelemahan isterinya
tersebut. Ketiga  jumlah wanita lebih banyak dibanding jumlah laki-laki  khususnya setelah
terjadi peperangan. Di situ terdapat kemaslahatan yang harus didapat oleh sebuah
masyarakat dan para wanita yang tidak menginginkan hidup tanpa suami dan keinginan
hidup tenang  cinta dan terlindungi serta menikmati sifat keibuan.
Namun permasalahan yang harus dihadapi bahwa kebolehan seorang suami untuk
beristeri lebih dari satu bukan hanya dikarenakan kondisi mendesak sebagaimana tersebut di
atas. Katakanlah itu adalah pasal yang harus dimiliki oleh seorang suami sebelum
berpoligami. Namun ada pasal penting lainnya yang wajib dipenuhi setelah poligami itu
terealisasi yaitu seorang suami harus berlaku adil dalam memberikan nafkah. Kewajiban bagi
seorang suami untuk berlaku adil dalam memberikan nafkah terhadap isteri-isterinya adalah
konsekuensi dari tindakan berpoligami dalam Islam. Sikap adil dimaksud berarti seorang
suami dapat memenuhi hak kewajibannya terhadap isteri-isterinya secara proporsional
sesuai dengan kebutuhan secara wajar.
Nafkah itu ada yang bersifat lahiriyah  yaitu nafkah yang bersifat materi dan
immateri (batiniyah). Sehubungan dengan pembagian nafkah tersebut maka keadilan pun
terbagi menjadi dua yaitu keadilan dalam memberikan nafkah lahiriyah dan keadilan dalam
memberikan nafkah batiniyah. Pada keadilan bentuk pertama  seorang suami dituntut untuk
berlaku adil terhadap isteri-isterinya dalam memberikan makan  minum  pakaian  rumah 
serta waktu giliran. Pemenuhan rasa keadilan bentuk pertama ini sangat mungkin dapat
dilakukan oleh seorang suami terhadap isteri-isterinya. Maka jika seorang suami tidak dapat
40

berlaku adil dalam nafkah lahir ini yang mengakibatkan isteri-isteri terzalimi  maka haram
bagi laki-laki untuk berpoligami. Allah swt berfirman dalam al-Quran surat al-Nisa ayat 3:
L*R CN NDEN L'LEN LHR N L#LK)N/-P 'HN NAL'HOD/P 9R N*LD'QN N #LER O*AR .P LFR P%NAL9N 'N(1O HN L+N D'N O+HN LINFR +EN L!P '3N PFD'LFN EP LER CO NDL(N '7N L'EN L'H-O CP FR 'NA
'HODHO9N*LD'QN N #LINF/R N #LCN DPN0LER CO OF'EN JRN #
Artinya: Kawinilah wanita-wanita (lain) yang kamu senangi: dua  tiga atau empat. Kemudian
jika kamu takut tidak akan dapat berlaku adil  maka (kawinilah) seorang saja  atau budak-budak
yang kamu miliki. Yang demikian itu adalah lebih dekat kepada tidak berbuat aniaya.
Rasulullah bersabda:

(/H'/LH(#LG'H1)LKD'P&'EN
Artinya: Siapa yang memiliki dua orang isteri tapi ia lebih berpihak kepada salah satunya  maka
pada hari kiamat ia berjalan dalam keadaan menarik salah satu pundaknya (miring). (HR. Abu
Daud)
Adapun sesuatu yang dianggap perbuatan menzalimi dalam Hadits di atas adalah
ketidak-adilan seorang suami dalam memenuhi hak-hak isteri yang dipandang kuasa bagi
suami untuk memenuhinya seperti nafkah lahir dan waktu gilir.
Terkait dengan keadilan bentuk kedua yakni keadilan yang bersifat batin (LJQO P(DRNBDR'LDO JREN DRN') 
kecenderungan hati/cinta. Usaha untuk berlaku adil dalam membagi cinta kepada isteri-isteri
inilah yang sesungguhnya sangat berat bagi seorang suami. Dan hal ini sudah bisa dipastikan
tidak dapat dilakukan oleh suami untuk berlaku adil sebagaimana diisyaratkan oleh al-
Quran:
L)P NBQN DLN9LEO DR 'CN L'GN H1O N0N*NALDP JR EN DR 'LDQN CO L'HODJEP N*LD'N NALER O*5R 1N -N LHR NDHN L!P '3N PFD'LFN JR (N L'HOD/P 9R N*LFR N #L'HO9J7P N*3R N*LFR NDHN
'EK J-P 1N L'1K HOA:N LFN 'CN LN'DDQNQN LFQN P%NAL'HOBQN*N*HN L'H-O DP5R O*LFR P%HN
Artinya: Dan kamu sekali-kali tidak akan dapat berlaku adil di antara isteri- isteri (mu)  walaupun
kamu sangat ingin berbuat demikian  karena itu janganlah kamu terlalu cenderung (kepada yang
kamu cintai)  sehingga kamu biarkan yang lain terkatung-katung. Dan jika kamu mengadakan
perbaikan dan memelihara diri (dari kecurangan)  maka sesungguhnya Allah Maha Pengampun
lagi Maha Penyayang. (QS. an-Nisa:129)
Kalau seandainya keadilan membagi cinta ini menjadi syarat yang mutlak bagi
seorang suami  maka tertutup hukum kebolehan bagi seorang suami untuk berpoligami
41

meskipun sudah berada pada kondisi yang darurat. Oleh karena sulitnya berlaku adil dalam
membagi cinta  maka Menurut Yusuf Qardhawi ini adalah keadilan yang dimaafkan dan
diberikan toleransi  namun tidak termaafkan untuk nafkah lahir.
Ayat ini juga dapat dipahami bahwa seorang suami yang berpoligami tidak hanya
untuk berkomitmen untuk adil  karena ayat tersebut memastikan bahwa siapapun seorang
suami tidak akan pernah bisa berbuat adil kepada isteri-isterinya  karena itu penting
keharusan adanya maslahat yang lebih besar untuk isteri-isteri dan anak-anaknya. Perhatikan
bagaimana tingginya konflik berumah tangga bagi para suami yang beristeri lebih dari satu 
perseteruan antara para isteri  kecemburuan buta  permusuhan antara para anak  perebutan
harta waris dan dosa-dosa yang ditimbulkan akibat perilaku berpoligami. Karena itu 
pikirkan kemaslahatan yang lebih penting jika melakukan poligami seperti untuk
kepentingan dakwah  mendapatkan keturunan hebat  dan kemaslahatan buat seluruh
anggota keluarganya.
Contoh praktik poligami ideal adalah Baginda Rasulullah saw yang selalu berusaha
untuk berlaku adil sampai kepada masalah bepergian dan untuk memenuhi rasa keadilan
tersebut  Rasulullah mengundi di antara isteri-isterinya. Bagi yang keluar undiannya  maka
dialah yang menjadi teman pergi Rasulullah  hal ini dilakukan oleh Rasulullah supaya tidak
melukai perasaan dan meminta kerelaan dari isteri-isteri yang tidak pergi bersama Rasul.
Bukan hanya itu  Beliau berpoligami hanya semata untuk kepentingan dakwah sebab istri-
istri yang dinikahi oleh beliau adalah wanita-wanita yang sangat memerlukan bantuan 
lihatlah sosok wanita yang beliau nikahi semuanya adalah janda kecuali Sayyidatina Aisyah
r.a.
Meskipun poligami diizinkan dalam ajaran Islam dengan syarat-syarat ketat  tetapi
realitasnya ternyata menyisakan penderitaan bagi istri  orang tua dan anak-anak. Hancurnya
rumah tangga dan putusnya cinta kasih di antara mereka  bahkan anak yang tidak berdosa
pun sering menjadi korban. Karena itu  poligami hendaknya dihindari oleh setiap suami 
sebab mengandung kemudharatan bagi setiap anggota keluarga. Hal ini terungkap dalam
hadis Nabi SAW Riwayat Imam al-Bukhari  Muslim  Turmudzi dan Ibnu Majah dari Miswar
bin Makhramah yang mengangkat peristiwa yang dialami keluarga putri Nabi SAW
(Fatimah) ketika Ali akan melakukan poligami.
Miswar bin Makhramah bercerita bahwa ia mendengar Rasulullah SAW berdiri di atas
mimbar seraya berkata  Sesungguhnya keluarga Hisyam bin al-Mughirah meminta izinku untuk
42

menikahkan putrinya dengan Ali bin Abi Thalib. Aku tidak izinkan. Aku tidak izinkan. Aku tidak
izinkan. Kecuali jika Ali bin Abi Thalib lebih memilih menceraikan putriku dan menikah dengan
putrinya (Keluarga Hisyam). Sesungguhnya putriku adalah darah dagingku  menyusahkannya berarti
menyusahkanku dan menyakitinya berarti menyakitiku [H.R. al-Bukhari  Muslim  at-Turmudzi
dan Ibnu Majah].
Hadits di atas mempertegas prinsip monogami dalam pernikahan. Nabi SAW
melarang Ali bin Abi Thalib untuk melakukan poligami  bahkan beliau meminta Ali memilih
menceraikan Fatimah putri Nabi jika tetap menikahi gadis tersebut. Alasan yang diajukan
Rasulullah adalah beliau tidak rela andaikan poligami itu akan menyusahkan dan menyakiti
putri tercintanya Fatimah  yang berarti menyakiti perasaan Rasulullah SAW sebagai ayahnya.
Jika kedua kelompok hadis di atas digabungkan  dapat dipahami bahwa hadis-hadis
tentang poligami tidak menyebutkan bahwa poligami itu perbuatan sunah atau yang
dianjurkan. Poligami dalam Islam merupakan ketentuan pembatasan yang pernah terjadi
sebelumnya (yang tidak terbatas). Poligami dilakukan dengan memenuhi ketentuan adil.
2. Hikmah dari Poligami
Berpoligami bagi sebagian orang terkadang tidak terlalu sulit untuk dilakukan.
Permasalahannya adalah tidak mudah untuk berlaku adil dalam memenuhi sesuatu yang
menjadi hak para isteri. Terlihat  banyak suami yang beristeri lebih dari satu tapi sebenarnya
mereka tidak mampu untuk memberikan nafkah. Motif mereka berpoligami bukan karena
masalah darurat  tapi karena ingin memperturutkan hawa nafsu seksual. Kalaupun mereka
mampu memberikan nafkah namun terkadang perlakuan suami kepada isteri-isterinya
banyak berlaku tidak adil dalam pemenuhan kebutuhan seperti makan  pakaian  tempat
tinggal  dan waktu bergilir.
Oleh karena itu  alasan kebolehan berpoligami bagi sang suami dikarenakan terdapat
kondisi darurat dan syarat berlaku adil terdapat hikmah di dalamnya. Rasyid Ridha
mengemukakan empat hikmah. 1) Untuk mendapatkan anak bagi suami yang subur dan
isteri yang mandul. 2). Menjaga keutuhan keluarga tanpa harus mencerai isteri pertama meski
ia tidak berfungsi semestinya sebagai isteri karena cacat fisik dan sebagainya. 3). Untuk
menyelamatkan suami yang hiperseks dari perbuatan free sex. Tercatat di beberapa negara
Barat yang melarang poligami mengakibatkan merajalelanya praktek prostitusi dan free sex
(kumpul kebo) dan lahirnya anak-zina yang mencapai jumlah cukup tinggi. 4).
43

Menyelamatkan harkat dan martabat wanita dari krisis akhlak (melacur)  terutama bagi
mereka yang tinggal di negara yang jumlah wanitanya lebih banyak dibanding laki-laki
akibat peperangan misalnya.
Sedangkan hikmah kebolehan Rasulullah beristeri lebih dari empat bukanlah karena
dorongan hawa nafsu sebagaimana yang dituduhkan oleh kaum orientalis  tapi mengandung
hikmah yang besar  yaitu kepentingan dakwah Islam sebagaimana dikemukakan oleh Abbas
Mahmud al-Aqqad sebagai berikut:
a. Untuk kepentingan pendidikan dan pengajaran agama. Semua isteri Nabi yang
berjumlah sembilan dapat dijadikan sumber informasi bagi umat Islam yang hendak
mengetahui ajaran-ajaran Nabi dan praktek kehidupan beliau dalam berkeluarga 
bermasyarakat  terutama masalah rumah tangga.
b. Untuk kepentingan politik  yaitu mempersatukan suku-suku bangsa Arab dan sekaligus
menarik mereka masuk Islam. Seperti perkawinan Nabi dengan Juwairiyah putri al-Harist
kepala suku bani al-Musthaliq dan Shafiyah  seorang tokoh dari Bani Quiraizhah dan Bani
al-Nadhir.
c. Untuk kepentingan sosial dan kamanusiaan. Seperti perkawinan beliau dengan janda
dermawan bernama Khadijah dan janda pahlawan Islam seperti Saudah binti Zumaah
(suaminya meninggal setelah kembali dari hijrah ke Abesenia)  Hafsah binti Umar
(suaminya gugur pada perang badar)  Hindun Ummu Salamah (suaminya gugur di
perang Uhud).
Seandainya saja motif Rasul untuk menikah lebih dari satu karena dorongan sex 
mungkin wanita yang dinikahi adalah gadis-gadis cantik bangsa Arab. Tetapi hal itu sama
sekali tidak dilakukan oleh Rasulullah tapi justru dengan Siti khadijah yang umurnya lebih
tua 15 tahun dibandingkan umur beliau. Demikian dengan isteri-isteri beliau yang lain 
semuanya dinikahi bukan karena tuntutan nafsu  tapi bermotif dakwah yang ternyata motif
tersebut dapat membantu keberhasilan tugas beliau sebagai utusan Allah. Dengan demikian 
pada pernikahan Rasul terdapat hikmah yang tinggi yang bernilai dakwah  pendidikan dan
sosial kemasyarakatan. Argumentasi logis di atas dapat meruntuhkan segala tuduhan
negatif yang dilontarkan oleh kaum orientalis terhadap kebolehan rasul bersiteri lebih dari
satu.
44

Lebih lanjut Al-Jarjawi menguraikan pula hikmah pembatasan poligami sampai
empat orang istri  yaitu: pertama  jumlah empat istri merupakan kompilasi dari empat unsur
bumi dan merupakan simbol atas kesinambungan spesies manusia. Kedua  jumlah empat
sesuai dengan sumber nafkah yakni kepemimpinan  perdagangan  pertanian dan industri.
Ketiga  empat adalah jumlah pembagian cuaca dalam setahun  pergantian yang memperbaiki
semua sendi kehidupan manusia  kehidupan tumbuhan  dan kehidupan binatang. Keempat 
empat orang istri dianggap cukup untuk mendapatkan setiap mereka satu hari kemudian
menanti dalam rentang waktu tiga hari lainnya. Rentang waktu tiga hari ini dirasa cukup
untuk menumbuhkan kerinduan dan kasih sayang. Seorang istri tidak bisa menanti lebih dari
waktu tersebut. Kelima  sesungguhnya syariat menjadikan jumlah tiga sebagai tambahan
karena ia sudah menjadi satu standarisasi umum dalam banyak hukum di berbagai negara.
Poligami dengan batasan empat orang istri memang diperbolehkan oleh syariat
Muhammad tetapi dengan syarat berlaku adil kepada semua istrinya. Tetapi waspadalah 
Ketika suami tidak mampu memberikan hak yang sama pada setiap istrinya  maka
terkoyaklah urusan rumah tangganya dan buruklah bahtera rumah tangganya pada akhirnya
akan membawa permasalahan besar bagi setiap anggota keluarganya. Para istri pun
disibukkan dengan pertengkaran antara mereka  memperebutkan harta suaminya  sehingga
melupakan kewajiban mereka untuk mengatur rumah tangga. Itulah aspek-aspek yang
menjadi pertimbangan seorang berpoligami. Karena itulah surat an-Nisa ayat 3 secara tegas
&.Kemudian jika kamu takut tidak akan dapat berlaku adil  maka kawinilah seorang saja.
(QS. An-Nisa:3).
D. Konsep Nikah Mutah
Semarak nikah mutah atau sering disebut dengan nikah kontrak nampaknya masih
menghiasi kehidupan sebagian kecil masyarakat. Keprihatinan dan kekhawatiran pun
muncul dari orang tua  tokoh masyarakat  pendidik bahkan ulama terhadap pernikahan yang
terkesan main-main ini. Praktek nikah mutah seperti tersebut terjadi selain karena terdapat
legitimasi dari kelompok yang membolehkan  juga ditemukan alasan untuk terhindar dari
perzinahan demi memenuhi tuntutan sex sesaat. Untuk dapat menguji keabsahan nikah
mutah yang banyak dilakukan oleh orang yang tinggal jauh dari isterinya karena memenuhi
45

tugas kerja misalnya  bahkan tak luput pelakunya adalah pemuda dan mahasiswa  berikut
ini akan dijelaskan tentang hukum nikah mutah.
1. Pengertian dan Dasar Nikah Mutah.
Kata mutah ( L)N9R*EO )  berasal dari bahasa Arab yang mempunyai arti antara lain bekal
yang sedikit dan barang yang menyenangkan. Pengertian ini sejalan dengan kata mutah yang
terdapat dalam al-Quran yang berarti bercampur (bersenang-senang bersama istri dengan
bersenggama) dan pemberian yang menyenangkan oleh suami kepada isterinya yang dicerai.
Firman Allah swt:
L'9K 'N*EN LOG1O N/NBL1P P*LBREO DR'LIND9N HNL1O N/NBL P93P HEO DR'LINDL9N LFQN GO HO9 P*EN HNLK)6N J1P NALFQN GO NDL'H6O 1P ARN*LHRN#LFQN GO H3QO EN N*LERNDL'EN L!N '3N P FD'LEOO*BRQND7N LFR P%LERCO JRND9N L-N 'NF O LD'N
(232)LFN JPF3P -R EO DR'LIND9N L'QKB-N LAP H1O 9R EN DR'P(
Artinya: Tidak ada kewajiban membayar (mahar) atas kamu  jika kamu menceraikan isteri-
isterimu sebelum kamu bercampur dengan mereka dan sebelum kamu menentukan maharnya. Dan
hendaklah kamu berikan suatu mut`ah (pemberian) kepada mereka. Orang yang mampu menurut
kemampuannya dan orang yang miskin menurut kemampuannya (pula)  yaitu pemberian menurut
yang patut. Yang demikian itu merupakan ketentuan bagi orang-orang yang berbuat kebajikan.
(QS. Al-Baqarah: 236)
Yusuf Qardhawi memberikan pengertian nikah mutah secara terminologi  yaitu
seorang laki-laki mengikat (menikahi) seorang perempuan untuk waktu yang ditentukan
dengan imbalan uang yang tertentu pula. Di Indonesia  kawin mutah ini popular dengan
sebutan kawin kontrak.
Uraian di atas memberikan gambaran cukup jelas tentang nikah mutah. Bahwa
tidaklah nikah mutah itu dilakukan  kecuali kecenderungan seseorang untuk memenuhi
kebutuhan seksual  berakhir tanpa talak (cerai) karena secara otomatis jika sudah habis waktu
kontrak yang telah ditentukan maka berakhir lah riwayat pernikahan itu. Dilihat dari
penetapan pembatasan waktu (taqit) tersebut  pernikahan semacam itu bertentangan
dengan syariat Islam yang menghendaki pernikahan itu tidak terbatas oleh waktu.
2. Hukum Nikah Mutah
Nikah mutah pada zaman Nabi diperbolehkan namun tidak berlaku untuk semua
orang hanya untuk orang tertentu dikarenakan terdapat suatu kondisi yang sangat mendesak.
Menurut Yusuf Qardhawi  rahasia diperbolehkan nikah mutah pertama kali pada zaman
Nabi  karena umat ketika itu berada pada masa transisi dari dunia Jahiliyah ke dunia Islam.
46

Pada zaman Jahiliyah  perzinahan merupakan budaya yang sudah menyebar luas. Ketika
Islam mewajibkan kepada kaum untuk pergi berjihad  mereka merasakan sangat berat tinggal
jauh dengan isteri-isteri mereka. Di antara kaum yang ikut berijihad dengan Rosulullah itu
ada yang memiliki iman yang kuat dan ada yang lemah. Mereka yang lemah imannya sangat
takut terjerumus ke jurang perzinahan. Sedangkan mereka yang kuat imannya bersikeras
untuk menghilangkan nafsu seksnya dengan cara mengebiri  sebagaimana informasi Hadits
yang diriwayatkan oleh Ibnu masud:
L(P LHRQN+D'P(LN)N#1R EN DR'L-N CP FRNFLLLLLLLFR N#L'NFNDLL5N .QN 1N HNLCN DPNL'0LFR 9N LP'DDGLDO HR3O 1N L'NF'GN NFNALJN 5P .R N*3R NFLQND'N#L'NFDROBNAL! '3N PFL'NFN9EN L3N JRNDHNLP'DDGLDP HR3O 1N L9N EN LH2O :R NFL'QNFCO
(GJD9LBA*E)LDM  N N#LINDP'
Artinya: Kami ikut berperang dengan Rosulullah dan istri-istri kami tidak ada di samping kami.
Kemudian kami bertanya kepada Rosulullah  bolehkah kami mengebiri? Maka Rosulullah melarang
kami untuk mengebiri dan memberikan keringanan kepada kami untuk menikahi perempuan
dengan membayar imbalan untuk waktu yang ditentukan. (HR. Bukhari Muslim)
Berdasarkan keterangan di atas  maka jelaslah bahwa kebolehan hukum nikah mutah
pada zaman Nabi itu memiliki alasan sebagai berikut:
a. Merupakan keringanan hukum (rukhsah) untuk memberikan jalan keluar dari
problematika yang dihadapi oleh dua kelompok orang yang imannya kuat dan imannya
lemah.
b. Sebagai langkah perjalanan hukum Islam menuju ditetapkannya kehidupan rumah
tangga yang sempurna untuk mewujudkan semua tujuan pernikahan yaitu melestarikan
keturunan  cinta kasih sayang dan memperluas pergaulan melalui perbesanan.
Terkait dengan hukumnya  dilihat dari prosesnya nampaknya langkah pengharaman
nikah mutah yang ditempuh oleh Islam dilakukan secara periodik seperti proses
pengharaman khamar. Rasulullah SAW memperbolehkan nikah mutah dalam kondisi
tertentu (darurat)  kemudian Rasulullah SAW mengharamkan nikah mutah sebagai bentuk
pernikahan. Sebagaimana Hadits yang diriwayatkan oleh Imam Muslim dalam Shahihnya
dari Syibrah al-Juhani bahwasanya ia berperang bersama Rasulullah saw pada waktu fathu
Makkah  maka Rasulullah mengizinkan mereka untuk melakukan nikah mutah. Ia berkata:
Maka kaum tetap melakukan nikah mutah itu sampai Rasulullah mengharamkan nikah
mutah. Dan dalam redaksi yang lain  terdapat Hadits yang berbunyi

Heading: Akad Ijarah (Sewa-Menyewa)

Akad ijarah dianggap sah jika memenuhi rukun-rukunnya yang meliputi:
1. Mujir dan musta'jir  yaitu pihak-pihak yang melakukan akad sewa. Mujir adalah orang yang menyewa  mustajir adalah orang yang memberi sewa.
2. Sighat  ijab qabul antara mujir dan mustajir.
3. Ajr atau upah yang dibayarkan.
4. Barang yang disewakan.

Zakat Tanah yang Disewakan

Pengertian zakat tanah yang disewakan adalah zakat yang dikeluarkan dari tanah yang disewakan. Zakat tanah yang disewakan harus memenuhi beberapa komponen dalam transaksi zakat hasil tanah yang disewakan:
a. Sebidang tanah yang disewakan ('D#16 'DEO3*N# N1))
b. Pemilik tanah (5'-( 'D#16): Orang yang menyewakan tanahnya kepada orang lain.
c. Penyewa tanah ('DEO3*N# P1) sekaligus penggarap tanah yang disewakan.
d. Ajru (upah) yang dibayarkan oleh penyewa kepada pemilik tanah.

Kewajiban untuk mengeluarkan zakat hasil tanah yang disewakan didasari oleh ayat al-Quran berikut:
""Dan Dialah yang telah menjadikan kebun-kebun yang berjunjung dan yang tidak berjunjung  pohon korma  tumbuh-tumbuhan yang beraneka ragam buahnya  zaitun dan delima yang serupa bentuk dan warnanya dan tidak sama rasanya. Makanlah buah-buahan tersebut jika panen dan keluarkanlah haknya (zakatnya) ketika panen. Dan janganlah kamu berlebih-lebihan. Sesungguhnya Allah tidak menyukai orang yang berlebih-lebihan."" (QS. Al-An'am: 141)

Vitamin B12 or cyanocobalamin  is a complex corrinoid compound found exclusively from animal dietary sources  such as meat  eggs
and milk. It is critical in normal DNA synthesis  which in turn affects erythrocyte maturation and in the formation of myelin sheath.
Vitamin-B12 is used to find out neurological abnormalities and impaired DNA synthesis associated with macrocytic anemias. For
diagnostic purpose  results should always be assessed in conjunction with the patients medical history  clinical examination and
other findings.

Females not on HRT: < 10 - 28 pg/mL
Female on HRT : < 10 - 144 pg/mL
Clinical Significance: During the early follicular phase  The Estradiol level is relatively constant and low. By day seven  The
dominant follicle is established and the Estradiol level rises significantly. The elevated Estradiol level suppresses the FSH level by
negative feedback on the Hypothalamus and Pituitary gland and triggers a rapid rise of LH. Elevated Estradiol levels in females
may also result from primary or secondary ovarian hyperfunction. Very high Estradiol levels are found during the induction of
ovulation for assisted reproduction therapy or in pregnancy. Decreased Estradiol levels in females may result from either the lack
of ovarian synthesis or a lesion in the Hypothalamus-Pituitary Axis.

EST. GLOMERULAR FILTRATION RATE (eGFR) CALCULATED 128 mL/min/1.73 m2

> = 90 : Normal
60 - 89 : Mild Decrease
45 - 59 : Mild to Moderate Decrease
30 - 44 : Moderate to Severe Decrease
15 - 29 : Severe Decrease
Clinical Significance
The normal serum creatinine reference interval does not necessarily reflect a normal GFR for a patient. Because mild and
moderate kidney injury is poorly inferred from serum creatinine alone. Thus  it is recommended for clinical laboratories to routinely
estimate glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)  a gold standard measurement for assessment of renal function  and report the value
when serum creatinine is measured for patients 18 and older  when appropriate and feasible. It cannot be measured easily in
clinical practice  instead  GFR is estimated from equations using serum creatinine  age  race and sex. This provides easy to
interpret information for the doctor and patient on the degree of renal impairment since it approximately equates to the
percentage of kidney function remaining. Application of CKD-EPI equation together with the other diagnostic tools in renal
medicine will further improve the detection and management of patients with CKD.

A black smith aged 18 years came with a history of burns in his right hand. Examination showed loss of pain and temperature sensibility over the thorax and both upper extremities. There was no loss of touch sensibility  no ataxia or loss of motor functions except that there was weakness and atrophy of the small muscles of both hands.

{{MEDICALLY_RELEVANT}}
Heading: Diagnosis

The diagnosis is Syringomyelia.

{{MEDICALLY_RELEVANT}}
Heading: Tactile Sensibility Sparing

Tactile sensibility was spared because in syringomyelia  the lesion typically involves the central gray matter of the spinal cord  which contains the pain and temperature pathways  while the dorsal columns that carry touch and proprioception are spared.

{{MEDICALLY_RELEVANT}}
Heading: Site of Lesion

The site of the lesion is in the central gray matter of the spinal cord.

{{MEDICALLY_RELEVANT}}
Heading: Atrophy of Small Hand Muscles

The atrophy of the small muscles of both hands is due to the involvement of the anterior horn cells in the spinal cord  which innervate these muscles  by the syrinx (fluid-filled cavity) in the central gray matter.

The provided raw text appears to contain some medically relevant information  likely a blood test report. However  the text is not in a clear  structured format  and some of the abbreviations and values are not easily interpretable. 

Based on the available information  the key elements that can be extracted are:
- IMA
- HM 8T1
- Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C): 4.9 (reference range not provided)

The rest of the text is not clearly interpretable and may contain additional test results or other medical information  but without more context  it is difficult to determine the exact nature of the document. Further clarification or a more structured medical report would be needed to provide a comprehensive interpretation.

A bartender aged 46 years received a stab wound in the back. The key findings are:

1. Wasting of the muscles of the right hand and loss of all forms of sensibility over a strip along the right ulnar border.
2. In the right leg  there was spastic paralysis with an increased knee jerk and loss of sense of posture and passive movement.
3. On the left side  the motor function was normal but there was loss of sensation of pain and temperature over the entire left half of the body as high as the level of the third rib  but no disturbance in proprioceptive sensibility.

{{MEDICALLY_RELEVANT}}
Heading: Diagnosis

The diagnosis is Brown-Séquard syndrome  which is caused by a unilateral lesion of the spinal cord.

{{MEDICALLY_RELEVANT}}
Heading: Explanation

1. The loss of pain and temperature sensation on the left side is due to the injury of the ipsilateral spinothalamic tract  which crosses horizontally in the lesion.
2. The spastic paralysis and loss of proprioception in the right leg is due to the injury of the contralateral corticospinal and posterior column-medial lemniscus pathways.
3. The wasting of the right hand muscles and loss of sensation along the right ulnar border is due to the involvement of the ipsilateral C8 spinal segment.
4. The dorsal column tract is intact  explaining the preserved proprioceptive sensation.

1. LT3 & T4 values may be altered due to changes in serum proteins  pregnancy  drugs  nephrosis etc. In such cases Free T3 and Free T4 may give more appropriate thyroid status. T3 levels fluctuate rapidly to stress and non thyroid illness.
2. TSH values may be transiently altered in fever  severe infections  liver disease  renal and heart failure  severe burns  trauma and surgery.
3. Drugs that decrease TSH values include L-DOPA  Glucocorticoids  Heparin. Drugs that increase TSH include Iodine  Lithium  Amiodarone.
4. TSH exhibits diurnal rhythm  peaks at 2.00-4.00 AM and has lowest level at 5.00-6.00 PM.

Heading: Aspergillosis Infection Treatment

The provided text discusses a 44-year-old patient with an aspergillosis infection who is to receive treatment with amphotericin B. The question asks which adjunctive measure is used to lessen the occurrence of nephrotoxicity associated with amphotericin B treatment.

The correct answer is D. Normal saline boluses.

Amphotericin B is a potent antifungal medication  but it can also cause nephrotoxicity (kidney damage) as a side effect. To help mitigate this  normal saline boluses (rapid intravenous infusion of a salt solution) are commonly used as an adjunctive measure to help maintain adequate hydration and kidney function during amphotericin B treatment.

The other options are not the correct adjunctive measures for reducing amphotericin B-associated nephrotoxicity:
A. Test dose of amphotericin is not an adjunctive measure for reducing nephrotoxicity.
B. Furosemide is a diuretic that can actually worsen kidney function in this context.
C. Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine used for premedication to prevent infusion reactions  not specifically for reducing nephrotoxicity.

as
move his sholder to some extent  but otherwise all four extremities remained paralysed. At this time he
developed increased muscle tone and hy peractive stretch reflexes in both arms and legs. Also when either foot
was dorsiflexed sustained clonus of the ankle was seen. Babinski sign could be elicited bilaterally. Stimulation
ofone foot caused withdrawal of that foot and also flexion of the other leg. He had to be catheterised to allow
drainage of the urinary bladder.

Heading: Questions

1. What is the neurological abnormality produced by the accident?
2. What is the level of the lesion?
3. Why were the stretch reflexes hyperactive?

{{MEDICALLY_RELEVANT}}
Heading: Answers

1. The neurological abnormality produced by the accident is an upper motor neuron lesion (UMNL).

2. The level of the lesion is at the cervical spinal cord.

3. The stretch reflexes were hyperactive due to the recovery of reflex excitability caused by the denervation hypersensitivity. This is due to the loss of inhibitory control of supraspinal centers  leading to exaggerated reflexes.

The stages of the patient's condition are:
1) Stage of spinal shock - Hypotension
2) UMN lesion
3) Recovery of reflex excitability due to denervation hypersensitivity of the gamma motor neurons.

Heading: Liver Function Profile

The provided raw text discusses various liver enzymes and their significance in determining liver health:

AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase) levels are increased during acute hepatitis  sometimes due to a viral infection  ischemia to the liver  chronic hepatitis  obstruction of bile ducts  and cirrhosis.

ALP (Alkaline Phosphatase) is a protein found in almost all body tissues  with higher amounts in the liver  bile ducts  and bone. Elevated ALP levels are seen in biliary obstruction  osteoblastic bone tumors  osteomalacia  hepatitis  hyperparathyroidism  leukemia  lymphoma  Paget's disease  rickets  sarcoidosis  etc. Lower-than-normal ALP levels are seen in hypophosphatasia  malnutrition  protein deficiency  and Wilson's disease.

GGT (Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase) is an enzyme found in cell membranes of many tissues  mainly in the liver  kidney  and pancreas. Elevated serum GGT activity can be found in diseases of the liver  biliary system  and pancreas  such as obstructive liver disease  high alcohol consumption  and use of enzyme-inducing drugs.

Total Protein  also known as total protein  is a biochemical test for measuring the total amount of protein in serum. Higher-than-normal levels may be due to chronic inflammation or infection  including HIV and hepatitis B or C  multiple myeloma  and Waldenström's disease. Lower-than-normal levels may be due to agammaglobulinemia  bleeding (hemorrhage)  burns  glomerulonephritis  liver disease  malabsorption  malnutrition  nephrotic syndrome  and protein-losing enteropathy.

Albumin is the most abundant protein in human blood plasma  produced in the liver. Low blood albumin levels (hypoalbuminemia) can be caused by liver disease like cirrhosis of the liver  nephrotic syndrome  protein-losing enteropathy  burns  hemodilution  increased vascular permeability or decreased lymphatic clearance  malnutrition  and wasting.

dikembangkan berupa kebaikan bagi si muzakki dan kemaslahatan ekonomi bagi para
mustahiq. Sebagaimana firman Allah swt:
'GN 'CQN 2N LFR EN L-N NDAR N #L/R NB
Artinya: Sesungguhnya beruntunglah orang-orang yang mensucikan dirinya. (QS.
al-Syams: 9)
Menurut syara  para ulama mendefinisikannya dengan Harta tertentu yang
wajib dikeluarkan sebagiannya kepada para mustahiq. Sedangkan Sayyid Sabiq
mendefinisikan  Zakat adalah suatu nama hak Allah yang harus dikeluarkan oleh manusia
kepada fuqara. Selanjutnya Sabiq menambahkan  Dinamakan zakat karena mengharap
berkah  pensucian diri  dan bertambahnya kebaikan. Hal ini sejalan dengan firman Allah
swt:
'GN (P LER GP JC P 2N O*HN LER GO 1O G P 7N O*LK )NBN/5N LER GP DP'HN ER N #LFR EP L0R .O
Artinya: Ambilah dari harta mereka shadaqah yang dapat membersihkan harta dan
mensucikan jiwa mereka. (QS. At-Taubah: 103).
Dari dua macam pengertian zakat seperti diungkapkan di atas dapat
disimpulkan bahwa zakat adalah kewajiban seseorang untuk mengeluarkan sebagian
harta miliknya yang sudah memenuhi syarat untuk dizakati kepada orang yang
berhak menerimanya (mustahiq).
Zakat sering juga disebut shadaqah ( )B/5) karena tindakan itu adalah
tindakan yang benar (shidq). Istilah zakat dalam al-Qur'an sering sekali
penyebutannya digandengkan dengan kata sholat  ditemukan sebanyak 82 ayat.
Penyelarasan ini menunjukkan bahwa zakat merupakan rukun Islam yang sangat
penting setelah perkara sholat.

A. ZAKAT HASIL TANAH YANG DISEWAKAN
Dalam istilah ekonomi  zakat merupakan suatu tindakan pemindahan harta
kekayaan dari golongan kaya kepada golongan miskin (mustahik). Transfer kekayaan
berarti juga transfer sumber-sumber ekonomi. Rahardjo (1987) menyatakan bahwa
dengan menggunakan pendekatan ekonomi  zakat bisa berkembang menjadi konsep
kemasyarakatan (muamalah)  yaitu konsep tentang bagaimana cara manusia
melakukan kehidupan bermasyarakat termasuk di dalamnya bentuk ekonomi. Oleh
karena itu ada dua konsep yang selalu dikemukakan dalam pembahasan mengenai
sosial ekonomi Islam yang saling berkaitan yaitu pelarangan riba dan perintah
membayar zakat (Q.S al-Baqarah [2]: 276).
Mencermati judul di atas setidaknya terdapat pertanyaan dalam benak
saudara  siapa yang wajib mengeluarkan zakat dari tanah yang disewakan  apakah si
pemilik tanah atau pihak penyewa tanah. Sepintas jawabannya sudah dapat
ditentukan dari judul itu yaitu orang yang menyewa tanah karena dialah orang yang
mendapatkan secara langsung dari hasil tanah tersebut. Namun demikian 
ditemukan pendapat bahwa si pemilik tanahlah yang terkena kewajiban zakatnya
karena tanpa tanah tidak mungkin didapati hasil tanaman. Terdapat juga pendapat
yang mengatakan bahwa hukumnya dikembalikan kepada kesepakatan antara dua
belah pihak sebelum transaksi dilakukan  berikut bahasannya.
1. Pengertian dan Dasar Hukum Zakat Tanah yang Disewakan
Setelah memahami pengertian zakat  maka perlu juga memahami pengertian
sewa-menyewa atau ijarah. Sewa-menyewa adalah memanfaatkan suatu barang baik
barang milik sendiri atau barang orang lain. Istilah ini dikenal dalam Bahasa Arab
disebut dengan istilah ijarah yang berasal dari kata al-ajru yang mengandung arti upah
atau menjual manfaat. Zuhaily yang dikutip oleh Ismail Nawawi dalam bukunya
yang berjudul Fiqh Muamalah Klasik dan Kontemporer mengatakan bahwa
Transaksi sewa (ijarah) identik dengan jual beli  tetapi dalam sewa pemilikan
dibatasi dengan waktu tertentu.
10

Akad ijarah dianggap sah jika memenuhi rukun-rukunya yang meliputi
pertama  Mujir dan mustajir  yaitu pihak-pihak yang melakukan akad sewa. Mujir
yakni orang yang menyewa  mustajir yakni orang yang memberi sewa. Kedua  Sighat 
ijab qabul antara mujir dan mustajir. Ketiga  Ajr atau upah yang dibayarkan dan
keempat  Barang yang disewakan.
Dengan demikian  pengertian zakat tanah yang disewakan adalah zakat yang
dikeluarkan dari tanah yang disewakan. Zakat tanah yang disewakan harus
memenuhi beberapa komponen dalam transaksi zakat hasil tanah yang disewakan
sebagai berikut:
a. Sebidang tanah yang disewakan ( O )1N  N R #N*3R EO DR'L6O 1R ND#LN#)
b. Pemilik tanah ( O 61R ND#N#L (K -P '5N ): Orang yang menyewakan tanahnya kepada
orang lain.
c. Penyewa tanah( O 1 P R #N*3R EO DRN#) sekaligus penggarap tanah yang disewakan.
d. Ajru (upah) yang dibayarkan oleh penyewa kepada pemilik tanah.
Berdasar kepada beberapa ketentuan di atas  dalam penyewaan tanah 
sedikitnya terdapat dua pihak yang terlibat dalam transaksi penyewaan tanah yaitu
pemilik tanah dan penyewa  yang keduanya bersepakat mengadakan transaksi.
Dengan kata lain  zakat hasil tanah yang disewakan ( O )1N  N R #N*3R EO DR'L6P 1R ND'R'LO)'LCN 2N ) dapat
diartikan sebagai zakat hasil tanah yang langsung dihasilkan oleh tanah tersebut
berupa tumbuh-tumbuhan yang menghasilkan buah. Hasil dimaksud bisa berupa
makanan pokok  seperti padi  kurma  gandum atau buah-buahan  seperti  jeruk 
anggur  semangka  atau berupa sayur-sayuran  seperti ketimun  kacang  bawang  dan
lain sebagainya. Kewajiban untuk mengeluarkan zakat hasil tanah yang disewakan
didasari oleh ayat berikut ini:
LFN HO*JR 2QN D'HN LOGODCO O #L'KADPN*.R EO L9N 1R 2QN D'HN LDN .R QNFD'HN L*M '4N H1O 9R EN L1N JR :N HN L*M '4N H1O 9R EN L*M 'QNF N LN #4N FRN #LJ0P QN D'LHN GO HN

LFN JPA1P 3R EO DR 'L(QO -P OJLD'N LOGQNFP%
Artinya: Dan Dialah yang telah menjadikan kebun-kebun yang berjunjung dan yang
tidak berjunjung  pohon korma  tumbuh-tumbuhan yang beraneka ragam buahnya  zaitun
dan delima yang serupa bentuk dan warnanya dan tidak sama rasanya. Makanlah buah-
buah tersebut jika panen dan keluarkanlah haknya (zakatnya) ketika panen. Dan janganlah
11

kamu berlebih-lebihan. Sesungguhnya Allah tidak suka kepada orang yang berlebih-
lebihan. (QS. al-Anam: 141)
Sedangkan dasar dari Hadits mengenai wajibnya zakat hasil tanah:
L1P 4O O9DR'LAO 5R PFL)P NJPF'3QN D'P(LJ
N
BP 3O L'EN JR PAL1O HR 4O O9DR'LEO JR N:DR'HN 1O 'GN FR ND'R'L*P NB3N L'EN JR PA
(ED3EHL/E-'LG'H1)
Artinya: Tanaman yang tumbuh diari oleh air yang menggunakan alat  zakatnya
sebanyak lima persen. Sedangkan tanaman yang diairi oleh air hujan sebanyak sepuluh
persen.
Jika dicermati  mengapa hasil tanah yang diairi oleh alat lebih kecil dari pada
yang diairi oleh air hujan? Hal ini karena yang memakai alat itu membutuhkan biaya 
sedangkan yang memakai air hujan tidak membutuhkan biaya. Dengan demikian 
terdapat keadilan di dalamnya.
Zakat hasil tanah wajib dikeluarkan zakatnya setiap panen  tidak berlaku
untuknya haul (genap satu tahun) di dalamnya. Jika satu tahun itu dua kali panen 
maka zakatnya pun dua kali. Sedangkan ketentuan nisabnya menurut M. Syaltut  baik
sedikit atau banyak hasil panennya tetap dizakatkan karena menurutnya agar
tumbuh selalu sikap solidaritas sosial sebagai hikmah diwajibkannya zakat.
Menurut Majma al-Faqih al-Islam yang dikutip oleh Wahbah Zuhaili tentang
zakat harta yang tidak bergerak dan tanah yang disewakan terutama tanah yang
disewakan bukan untuk pertanian maka tidak ada kewajiban zakat pada aset harta
tidak bergerak dan tanah yang disewakan karena yang wajib dizakati adalah hasil
pemasukan dari harta yang tidak bergerak dan tanah yang disewakan itu. Jika tanah
yang disewakan itu menghasilkan seperti pertanian atau apapun yang dikelolanya
maka wajib mengeluarkan zakat sebesar 2 5 % setelah berlalunya waktu satu tahun
(haul) dari waktu al-qabdhu (penyerahterimaan) dengan tetap memperhatikan
terpenuhinya syarat-syarat zakat dan tidak ada hal-hal yang menghalanginya.
2. Siapa yang Wajib Mengeluarkan Zakatnya
Ketentuan bahwa zakat hasil tanah yang disewakan wajib dikeluarkan
zakatnya tidak memunculkan masalah jika tanah itu ditanami oleh pemiliknya
langsung. Persoalannya jika tanah itu disewakan kepada orang lain  maka hal ini akan
12

memunculkan masalah  siapa yang wajib mengeluarkan zakat hasil tanah yang
disewakan? Apakah si pemilik tanah atau si penyewa tanah (yang bercocok tanam).
Untuk menjawab kasus hukum ini tidak terdapat kata sepakat di kalangan para ulama
mereka berselisih dalam menetapkan hukumnya seperti diuraikan berikut ini.
Pertama  menurut Jumhur ulama  bahwa yang wajib mengeluarkan zakat hasil
tanah yang disewakan adalah pihak penyewa. Mereka beralasan karena yang
dikeluarkan zakatnya adalah hasil tanahnya bukan tanahnya hal ini diperkuat oleh
pendapat Mahmud Syaltut.

Artinya:Pendapat yang kami pegang bahwasanya kewajiban zakat ada pada pihak
penyewa yang langsung menggarap pertanian. Dan zakat merupakan hak pertanian
sebagai rasa syukur atas nimat berhasilnya pertanian. Dengan demikian penyewalah
yang dibebani untuk mengeluarkan zakat hasil tanah yang disewakan.
Kedua  menurut pendapat Abu Hanifah dan pengikutnya bahwa pemilik
tanahlah yang wajib mengeluarkan zakatnya karena dari sebab tanah itulah ada hasil
yang diperoleh.  tanpa tanah tak akan dapat dihasilkan apa-apa.
Ketiga  Imam Malik  Syafii  Imam At-Tsauri  Imam Ibnu Mubarak dan Imam
Ibnu Abu Tsaur berpendapat  penyewa tanahlah yang wajib membayar zakat 
pendapat ini sejalan dengan pendapat poin pertama.
Mencermati perselisihan pendapat tentang zakat hasil tanah yang disewakan
sebagaimana tersebut di atas dapat dikelompokkan perbedaannya menjadi dua
kelompok dengan alasannya masing-masing.
Pendapat pertama adalah ulama yang menetapkan bahwa si penyewa dalam
hal ini orang yang menggarap tanah yang wajib mengeluarkan zakat karena dialah
yang secara langsung memperoleh hasil dari tanah tersebut. Sedangkan pendapat
kedua menetapkan bahwa si pemilik tanahlah yang wajib mengeluarkan zakatnya
karena si pemilik tanah tersebut mendapatkan uang sewa. Jika diperbandingkan
alasan dari kedua kelompok tersebut  maka pendapat pertama memiliki argumentasi
yang lebih kuat karena hal ini diperkuat oleh firman Allah swt dalam surat al-Anam
13

ayat 141 seperti tersebut di atas yang menyebutkan bahwa hasil tanah yang wajib
dikeluarkan zakatnya bukan tanahnya. Diperkuat pula oleh Hadits Rasulullah
sebagaimana tersebut di atas. Berdasarkan kepada dalil-dali tersebut  fuqaha telah
sepakat bahwa yang dizakatkan adalah hasil tanah bukan tanahnya; maka sebidang
tanah yang tidak ditanami tidak wajib dikeluarkan zakatnya. Dengan demikian  tanah
yang disewakan jika dilihat dari hasilnya itu adalah milik sempurna pihak si
penyewa. Maka tidaklah tepat alasan yang diajukan oleh kelompok kedua yang
berpendapat bahwa pemilik tanahlah yang wajib mengeluarkan zakatnya.
Terkait dengan status tanah yang disewakan itu tetap milik orang yang
menyewakan dan di sisi lain terdapat kewajiban untuk mengeluarkan kewajiban
pajak. Jika berpegang kepada pendapat pertama seperti dijelaskan di atas maka
sebenarnya dengan status tersebut terjadi pembagian kewajiban yang cukup merata
karena kedua belah pihak memiliki andil  yakni si penyewa wajib membayar zakat
dan di sisi lain si pemilik tanah membayar pajak tanah  maka pendapat pertama ini
dipandang lebih adil dan tidak memberatkan kedua-belah pihak.
Solusi lain yang juga dapat dipandang bijak dalam pemerataan pengeluaran
zakat adalah pendapat yang ditawarkan oleh Abu Zahra. Menurutnya  kedua-duanya
baik si pemilik tanah maupun si penyewa sama-sama wajib mengeluarkan zakat. Hal
ini demi memenuhi keadilan dalam pemungutan zakat  dengan ketentuan pihak
penyewa mengeluarkan zakat tanaman setelah dikurangi harga sewa yang ia bayar
kepada pemilik tanah; sedangkan pemilik tanah mengeluarkan zakat atas dasar harga
sewa yang ia terima dari si penyewa; yang berarti ia mengeluarkan zakat uang.
Dengan demikian keduanya terkena beban untuk mengeluarkan zakat.
Solusi lain yang dapat dipertimbangkan adalah jika kedua belah pihak sebelum
transaksi telah bersepakat untuk mengeluarkan zakatnya patungan dengan tujuan
agar keduanya tidak terlalu terbebani  maka zakat itu dapat dilakukan secara
patungan antara kedua belah pihak berdasarkan kesepakatan itu.
Adapun ketentuan zakat tanah yang disewakan untuk kegiatan usaha tersebut
diqiyaskan pada zakat perdagangan. Besaran nishabnya setara nishab emas dan perak
senilai 85 gram emas murni  zakatnya sebesar 2 5 %. Cara menghitung zakat
14

perdagangan yakni jumlah total harta dikurangi total biaya yang telah dikeluarkan 
kemudian dikalikan dengan 2 5 %.
Ketentuan di atas mensyaratkan syarat-syarat sebagai berikut: pertama  ada
niat yang diikuti usaha berdagang atau mengelola tanah. Kedua  mencapai waktu
satu tahun (haul) dihitung dari waktu usaha berdagang. Ketiga  mencapai nishab.
Keempat  harta dagang telah menjadi hak milik sempurna  telah dibeli secara tunai.
Kelima  tidak terkait hutang dengan pihak lain.
B. ZAKAT HASIL JASA (PROFESI)
Terhadap hukum zakat profesi  terdapat perbedaan pendapat diantara ulama.
Hal ini antara lain dikarenakan dasar hukum tentang zakat yang dikeluarkan dari
hasil usaha tersebut masih bersifat zhan (dugaan)  berikut bahasannya.
1. Pengertian dan Hukumnya
Dalam terminologi Arab  zakat penghasilan dan profesi lebih populer disebut
dengan istilah zakatu kasb al-amal wa al-mihan al- hurrah ( )1-D'LFGED'HLDE9D'L(3CL)'C2)  atau
zakat atas penghasilan kerja dan profesi bebas. Istilah itu digunakan oleh Yusuf Al-
Qardhawi dalam kitab Fiqhu Zakah dan Wahbah Az-Zuhaili dalam kitab Al Fiqhul
Islami wa Adillatuhu.
Kata profesi menurut kamus besar Bahasa Indonesia mengandung arti
sebidang pekerjaan yang dilandasi oleh pendidikan keahlian berupa keterampilan
dan kejuruan tertentu. Profesi secara istilah berarti suatu pekerjaan yang
membutuhkan pengetahuan  keahlian  dan kepintaran. Yusuf al-Qardhawi lebih jelas
mengemukakan bahwa profesi adalah pekerjaan atau usaha yang menghasilkan uang
atau kekayaan baik pekerjaan atau usaha itu dilakukan sendiri  tanpa bergantung
kepada orang lain  maupun dengan bergantung kepada orang lain  seperti
pemerintah  perusahaan swasta  maupun dengan perorangan dengan memperoleh
upah  gaji  atau honorarium.
Berdasar pengertian profesi di atas  maka zakat profesi dapat dimaknai sebagai
zakat pekerjaan yang sudah menjadi keahlian seseorang yang diperoleh melalui
proses pendidikan seperti dokter  dosen  pengacara  pilot  dan guru  semua contoh
15

pekerjaan ini dapat dikatakan profesi karena keahliannya diperoleh melalui proses
pendidikan yang cukup lama.
Gagasan zakat profesi dipelopori oleh Yusuf Qardhawi dalam kitabnya Fiqh Az
Zakah  yang cetakan pertamanya terbit tahun 1969. Namun tampaknya Yusuf
Qardhawi dalam hal ini mendapat pengaruh dari dua ulama lainnya  yaitu Abdul
Wahhab Khallaf dan Abu Zahrah. Dalil ayat al-Quran yang dijadikan dasar bagi
kewajiban zakat profesi yaitu QS. al-Baqarah. 267. Pekerjaan yang termasuk profesi
bersifat umum  tidak terbatas oleh keahlian yang diperoleh dari pendidikan; namun
juga mencakup semua jenis pekerjaan yang baik. Hal ini dipahami dari ayat :
LER O*(R 3N CN L'EN L*P 'N( JP 7N LFR EP L'HOBAP FRN #L'HOFEN '!N LFN J0P QN D'L'GN QOJN #'NJ
Artinya: Nafkahkanlah dari hasil usahamu yang baik. (QS. al-Baqarah: 267)
Dilihat dari ketergantungannya  profesi bisa dikelompokkan menjadi dua
bagian. Pertama  pekerja ahli yang berdiri sendiri  tidak terikat oleh pemerintah 
seperti dokter swasta  insinyur  pengacara  penjahit  tukang batu  guru  dosen 
wartawan dan konsultan. Kedua  profesi yang terkait dengan pemerintah atau
yayasan atau badan usaha yang menerima gaji setiap bulan. Menurut sebagian ulama 
seperti Ibnu Abbas  Ibnu Masud  dan Muawiyah  kedua kelompok profesi di atas 
baik yang wiraswasta atau pegawai yang terikat oleh suatu instansi  mereka dapat
terkena kewajiban mengeluarkan zakat profesinya ketika menerima upah/gaji
sebesar seperempat puluhnya. Jika rutinitas itu dilakukan maka tidak ada lagi
baginya kewajiban untuk mengeluarkan zakat pada akhir tahun.
Dilihat dari aspek penerimaannya  macam-macam profesi seperti tersebut di
atas dapat dikategorikan menjadi dua. Pertama  hasil usaha yang teratur dan pasti
setiap bulannya  yang termasuk ke dalam kelompok pertama ini seperti upah pekerja
dan gaji pegawai. Kedua  hasil yang tidak tetap dan tidak dapat dipastikan seperti
kontraktor  pengacara  royalti pengarang  konsultan  dan artis.
Dengan demikian  zakat profesi meliputi semua pekerjaan yang halal dan baik.
Zakat dapat dikeluarkan sesuai dengan waktu perolehannya setelah diambil terlebih
dahulu untuk kewajiban biaya terhadap keluarga dan biaya operasional. Seseorang
dengan profesinya yang berpenghasilan pas-pasan bahkan kurang untuk memenuhi
16

kebutuhan hidupnya bukanlah termasuk profesi yang wajib dikeluarkan zakatnya 
bahkan mereka tergolong orang yang berhak menerima zakat (mustahiq); seperti
tukang becak.
Dengan demikian  zakat profesi merupakan zakat wajib yang harus
dikeluarkan umat islam  apabila sudah memenuhi syarat untuk menjadi muzakki.
Indikator pengeluaran zakat profesi merupakan penghasilan yang diperoleh.
Semakin besar penghasilan  maka semakin besar juga zakat yang harus dikeluarkan.
Karena itu  ulama menetapkan nishab zakat prof disetarakan dengan zakat emas 
yakni minimal memiliki harta yang setara dengan harga 85% gram emas. Adapun
syarat-syarat lain yang harus dipenuhi adalah 1) harta kepemilikan penuh  yakni
harta profesi benar-benar milik sendiri; 2) penghasilan sudah memenuhi kebutuhan
pokok; dan 3)telah mencapai nishab; berdasarkan fatwa MUI minimal setara dengan
85 gram emas; sedangkan pendapat Abu Zahra  minimal setara dengan 930 liter atau
653 kg hasil panen. Sedangkan jumhur ulama yang dikutip oleh Sulaiman Rasyid
menetapkan nishabnya adalah setara dengan 93  6 gram Emas. Sedang syarat 4)  
bebas dari hutang; yakni muzakki benar-benar bebas dari hutang.
Fatwa Majelis Ulama Indonesia (MUI) menjelaskan bahwa penghasilan yang
dimaksud ialah setiap pendapatan seperti gaji  honorarium  upah  jasa  dan lain-
lainnya yang diperoleh dengan cara halal  baik rutin seperti pejabat negara  pegawai 
karyawan  maupun tidak rutin seperti dokter  pengacara  konsultan  dan sejenisnya 
serta pendapatan yang diperoleh dari pekerjaan bebas lainnya.
2. Cara Mengeluarkan dan Nisabnya
Berikut ini akan dijelaskan secara singkat cara mengeluarkan zakat profesi
seperti dokter  pengacara  pilot  dosen  artis dan sebagainya. Semua pekerja ini dapat
mengeluarkan zakat profesinya dengan cara tajil  yaitu mempercepat ketika mereka
menerima honor atau gaji. Berapa nisab (batas minimal) dan prosentase yang harus
dikeluarkan? Terjadi perbedaan pendapat para ulama terhadap penetapan nisabnya:
a. Abdurrahman Hasan  Imam Abu Zahra  dan Abdul Wahab Khallaf  mereka
berpendapat bahwa nisab zakat profesi sekurang-kurangnya setara dengan lima
17

wasaq atau 300 sha sekitar 930 liter atau 653 Kg hasil panen. Persentase zakat
disamakan (diqiyaskan) dengan zakat pertanian yang pengairannya
menggunakan alat (mesin)  yaitu sebesar 5 % setiap mendapatkan gaji atau honor.
b. Jumhur ulama berijtihad bahwa nisab zakat profesi adalah harta setara dengan
seharga emas 93 6 gram emas murni yang diambil dari penghasilan bersih setelah
dikeluarkan seluruh biaya hidup. Kelebihan inilah yang dihitung selama satu
tahun  lalu dikeluarkan zakatnya sebanyak 2 5 % setiap bulan. Prosentase ini
diqiyaskan dengan zakat mata uang yang telah ditetapkan oleh Hadits.
c. Terdapat juga pendapat yang mengatakan bahwa zakat profesi disamakan
dengan zakat rikaz (barang temuan) maka tidak ada syarat nisab dan
prosentasenya 20 persen pada saat menerimanya.
d. Majelis Ulama Indonesia (MUI) dalam fatwa MUI No 3 tanggal 7 Juni tahun 2003
menyebutkan bahwa semua bentuk penghasilan halal wajib dikeluarkan
zakatnya dengan syarat telah mencapai nishab dalam satu tahun  yakni senilai
emas 85 gram dalam setahun. Zakat penghasilan dapat dikeluarkan pada saat
menerima jika sudah cukup nishab. Jika tidak mencapai nishab  maka semua
penghasilan dikumpulkan selama satu tahun; kemudian zakat dikeluarkan jika
penghasilan bersihnya sudah cukup nishab.
C. Contoh Kasus
Ali adalah seorang pendidik golongan IV/a dengan masa kerja selama 20
tahun. Ia memiliki seorang istri dan tiga anak. Penghasilannya tiap bulan pada
tahun 2015 sebagai berikut:
a. Gaji dari Negara Rp. 4.300.000
c. Honor dari beberapa PTS Rp. 2.500.000
d. Honor dari yang lain Rp. 2.000.000
Pengeluaran setiap bulan:
a. Keperluan keluarga Rp. 3.000.000
b. Angsuran kredit rumah Rp. 1.250.000
18

c. Dan lain-lain Rp. 1.500.000
Kalkulasi
Penerimaan Rp. 8.800.000
Pengeluaran Rp. 5.750.000
Sisa Rp. 3.050.000
Jika sisa di atas dikalikan setahun  maka berjumlah Rp. 36.600.000. Jumlah
tersebut tidak memenuhi nisab emas  yakni 85 gram emas yang pada tahun 2015
seharga Rp 525.000 per gram  atau sekitar Rp .44.625.00. Dengan demikian  maka Pak
Ali belum diwajibkan mengeluarkan zakat.
Contoh lainnya adalah sebagai berikut:
Andi adalah seorang eksekutif muda di sebuah perusahaan IT.
Penghasilannya tiap bulan pada tahun 2021 sebagai berikut 
a. Gaji Pokok Rp. 15.000.000
b. Bonus dan Insentif Rp. 12.500.000
c. Honor dari yang lain Rp. 7.500.000
Pengeluaran setiap bulan:
a. Keperluan keluarga Rp. 5.000.000
b. Dan lain-lain Rp. 10.000.000
Kalkulasi
Penerimaan Rp. 25.000.000
Pengeluaran Rp. 15.000.000
Sisa Rp. 10.000.000
Jika sisa di atas dikalikan setahun  maka berjumlah Rp. 120.000.000. Jumlah
tersebut telah memenuhi nisab emas  yakni 85 gram emas yang pada tahun 2021
seharga Rp 79.738.415 -. Dengan demikian  maka Pak Andi diwajibkan mengeluarkan
zakat dengan perhitungan 2 5 % x Rp. 120.000.000 = Rp. 3.000. 000. Bila Pak Andi
mengeluarkannya secara tajil atau didahulukan  maka Pak Andi dapat
mengeluarkannya secara bulanan  hingga beliau hanya membayar Rp. 250.000 setiap
bulannya.
19

Uraian di atas merupakan konsep zakat profesi bagi yang mendukung adanya
zakat profesi. Namun dengan demikian  terdapat juga ulama yang mengatakan
bahwa zakat profesi itu tidak ada dengan alasan karena sulit menentukan jenis profesi
dan nisabnya. Mereka yang menolak zakat profesi tersebut karena mereka
memasukkan zakat profesi kepada zakat harta yang harus dibayar jika sudah
sempurna satu tahun (haul); dan mempertahankan harta dengan nilai nisab selama
satu tahun dari berbagai kebutuhan bukanlah sesuatu hal yang mudah.
Perlu dipahami bahwa mengeluarkan zakat adalah manifestasi dari keislaman
seseorang sebagai rasa syukur kepada Allah swt atas nikmat yang telah diterimanya.
Di antara nikmat tersebut adalah karena memiliki profesi. Maka ijtihad yang
menetapkan adanya zakat profesi yang belum pernah ada pada zaman klasik Islam
perlu direspons secara positif. Hukum Islam selalu relevan dengan perkembangan
zaman. Zakat profesi adalah hasil ijtihad yang sejalan dengan prinsip hukum Islam
yang memberikan pintu kemudahan  dalam hal ini penunaian zakat secara tajil
(disegerakan) sehingga dapat menghilangkan kealpaan seseorang dalam penunaian
zakat.
Seseorang dikatakan sudah wajib menunaikan zakat penghasilan apabila
mampu menyisihkan bagian dari penghasilannya dan mencapai nishab zakat
pendapatan yang minimal setara dengan harga 85 gram emas per tahun. Hal ini juga
dikuatkan dalam SK BAZNAS Tahun 2021 Tentang Nisab Zakat Pendapatan dan Jasa
tahun 2021  bahwa;
Nishab zakat pendapatan/ penghasilan pada tahun 2021 adalah senilai 85
gram emas atau setara dengan Rp79.738.415 - (Tujuh puluh sembilan juta tujuh
ratus tiga puluh delapan empat ratus lima belas rupiah) per tahun atau
Rp6.644.868 - (Enam juta enam ratus empat puluh empat ribu delapan ratus
enam puluh delapan rupiah) per bulan.
Dalam praktiknya  zakat penghasilan dapat ditunaikan setiap bulan dengan
nilai nishab penghasilan setiap bulan minimal 6.644.868. Mereka yang telah mampu
menyisihkan dari harta penghasilan dengan jumlah tersebut wajib mengeluarkan
zakatnya 2 5%. Sebagian berpendapat  bahwa nisab tersebut bukanlah diambil dari
sisa penghasilan setelah dikurangi dari kebutuhan pokok; namun dari jumlah
20

penghasilan secara keseluruhan tanpa harus dipotong untuk kebutuhan pokoknya;
sebab kebutuhan pokok terkadang sering dibuat-buat untuk menghindari kewajiban
mengeluarkan zakat profesinya.
C. ZAKAT PRODUKTIF
Kemunculan istilah di atas dapat dikatakan sebagai sebuah bentuk kritik
terhadap penyaluran zakat kepada mustahiq yang pada umumnya bersifat konsumtif.
Zakat yang diterima oleh mustahiq biasanya bersifat konvensional yaitu sekedar
untuk memenuhi kebutuhan hidup sehari-hari yang sifatnya menghabiskan.
Namun di sisi lain terdapat mustahiq yang keberadaannya masih produktif baik dari
tenaga  ilmu dan keterampilan. Mustahiq yang masih mampu produktif tersebut dapat
diberikan zakat berupa modal usaha untuk pengembangan kemampuan yang
dimilikinya. Permasalahannya yang kemudian muncul bagaimana hukum
penyaluran zakat untuk modal usaha? berikut bahasannya.
1. Gagasan Zakat Produktif
Zakat merupakan ibadah maal (materi) yang memiliki fungsi strategis untuk
membangun perekonomian umat Islam. Kedudukannya sebagai salah satu rukun
Islam mengharuskan umat Islam untuk mengimani dan melaksanakannya. Orang
yang menganggap zakat bukan rukun Islam  maka ia dapat dianggap kafir dan orang
yang tidak berzakat padahal telah diwajibkan maka ia telah melakukan perbuatan
dosa karena telah menolak perintah Allah dan telah mengabaikan hak para mustahiq.
Oleh karena itu  penunaian zakat bukan sekedar untuk menggugurkan kewajiban tapi
berdampak positif kepada kehidupan sosial karena keberadaannya dapat
mensejahterakan kehidupan bagi orang yang tidak mampu.
Ide untuk mengembangkan zakat sebagai modal usaha muncul ketika fokus
perhatian dilakukan secara seksama bahwa para fuqara dan masakin tidak semuanya
orang-orang yang memiliki keterbatasan kekuatan fisik. Di antara mereka terdapat
banyak yang memiliki kesehatan fisik dan keahlian yang dapat dikembangkan  tapi
mereka tidak memiliki modal. Sehingga keluar ide untuk memberikan zakat kepada
mereka untuk bisa dijadikan sebagai modal usaha yang dapat meningkatkan status
21

ekonominya dan sekaligus mengembangkan keahlian yang mereka miliki. Maka
pihak yang paling berperan dalam zakat produktif ini adalah kreatifitas mustahiq
untuk menjadikan zakat sebagai modal yang terus dikembangkan.
2. Prospek Zakat Produktif
Prospek ke depan  zakat yang diperoleh dari hasil usaha ini memiliki peluang
yang cerah jika pengelolaannya dilakukan secara baik dan profesional. Pengelolaan
itu dapat dilakukan melalui pengembangan sumber daya mustahiq yang potensial
yang jumlahnya cukup banyak. Lain halnya ketika menghadapi mustahiq zakat yang
konsumtif  yaitu yang tidak memiliki kemampuan dan keahlian untuk
mengembangkan zakat seperti orang jompo  anak yatim yang masih kecil  orang
dewasa yang cacat atau sakit berat maka zakat untuk mereka ini hanya untuk
membantu kelangsungan hidup mereka karena mereka lebih banyak bersifat pasif.
Bagi mustahiq zakat yang produktif atau disebut mustahiq aktif  mereka masih
berumur produktif dan memiliki badan yang sehat  maka selayaknya bagi mereka
zakat dapat disalurkan secara produktif yaitu dengan menjadikan zakat sebagai
modal usaha. Oleh karena itu diperlukan sikap proaktif dari mustahiq untuk
mencurahkan kemampuannya dalam pengembangan modal dari zakat itu.
Menurut hemat penulis  usaha pengembangan zakat menjadi modal usaha
memerlukan sumber daya manusia (SDM) yang cukup handal. Oleh karena itu
diperlukan upaya untuk meningkatkan SDM (sumber daya manusia) mustahiq
dengan mengadakan pelatihan atau training yang dapat dilakukan oleh badan 
seperti bazis atau pemerintah  sehingga mereka benar-benar memiliki keahlian yang
mapan untuk dapat mengembangkan modal usaha yang didapat dari zakat tersebut.
Selain itu di masyarakat terdapat banyak keahlian yang dimiliki oleh mereka yang
tergolong mustahiq yang tampaknya diperoleh tanpa melalui latihan khusus seperti
pedagang kaki lima  sopir  pengrajin tangan  tukang kuli batu  dan lain sebagainya.
Jika penyaluran zakat dilakukan dengan baik serta penggunaannya terbilang optimal 
maka hal ini akan dapat meningkatkan taraf ekonomi mereka yang tergolong lemah
untuk selanjutnya diharapkan kehidupan mereka tidak bergantung kepada zakat.
22

Untuk mereka  zakat hanya modal pertama saja selanjutnya mereka tidak lagi sebagai
mustahiq zakat  tapi menjadi orang yang wajib mengeluarkan zakat (muzakki).
Uraian di atas memperlihatkan bahwa sesungguhnya keberadaan zakat
produktif itu dapat dibenarkan. Pemberian modal kepada mustahiq zakat sebagai
modal usaha berarti memberikan perhatian kepada para mustahiq untuk hidup lebih
layak  hal ini merupakan ajaran Islam seperti diperkuat oleh al-Quran:

Artinya: Berinfaklah untuk orang-orang faqir yang terikat oleh jihad di jalan Allah 
mereka tidak mampu berusaha di bumi. Orang yang tidak tahu  menyangka mereka adalah
orang yang kaya karena memelihara diri dari meminta-minta. Kamu melihat mereka
dengan melihat sifat-sifatnya. Mereka tidak meminta-minta kepada orang secara
mendesak. Dan apa yang kamu nafkahkan di jalan Allah  sesungguhnya Allah Maha
Mengetahui. (QS. al-Baqarah: 273)
Arif Mufraini dalam Buku Akuntansi dan Manajemen Zakat (2006:147) telah
mengemas bentuk inovasi pendistribusian zakat yang dikategorikan dalam empat
bentuk: Pertama  distribusi bersifat konsumtif tradisional  yaitu zakat dibagikan
kepada mustahik untuk dimanfaatkan secara langsung  seperti zakat fitrah  atau zakat
mal yang dibagikan kepada para korban bencana alam. Kedua  distribusi bersifat
konsumtif kreatif. yaitu zakat yang diwujudkan dalam bentuk lain dari barangnya
semula  seperti diberikan dalam bentuk alat-alat sekolah atau beasiswa. Ketiga 
distribusi bersifat produktif tradisional  yaitu zakat diberikan dalam bentuk
barang-barang yang produktif seperti kambing  sapi  dan lain sebagainya. Pemberian
dalam bentuk ini dapat menciptakan usaha yang membuka lapangan kerja bagi fakir
miskin. Keempat  distribusi dalam bentuk produktif kreatif  yaitu zakat
diwujudkan dalam bentuk permodalan baik untuk menambah modal pedagang
pengusaha kecil ataupun membangun proyek sosial dan proyek ekonomis.
Dengan demikian  zakat produktif adalah zakat yang didistribusikan kepada
mustahik  yang dikelola dan dikembangkan melalui perilaku-perilaku bisnis.
Indikasinya adalah harta zakat dimanfaatkan sebagai modal yang diharapkan dapat
meningkatkan taraf ekonomi mustahik. Termasuk juga dalam pengertian zakat
23

produktif jika harta zakat dikelola dan dikembangkan oleh amil yang hasilnya
disalurkan kepada mustahik secara berkala. Lebih tegasnya zakat produktif adalah
zakat yang disalurkan kepada mustahik dengan cara yang tepat guna  efektif
manfaatnya dengan sistem yang serba guna dan produktif  sesuai dengan pesan
syariat dan peran serta fungsi sosial ekonomis dari zakat.
Hikmah yang dapat dipetik dari praktek zakat produktif diantaranya agar
terjadi komunikasi yang dapat menghilangkan menara gading antara si miskin
dengan si kaya. Efek yang ditimbulkannya menjadikan si muzakki (pemberi zakat)
akan merasa puas dan senang karena zakatnya bisa berkembang; di sisi lain
menjadikan mustahiq tidak menjadi mental pengemis dan tersalurkan
kemampuannya. Dengan demikian terjadi hubungan yang signifikan antara
keberadaan zakat produktif dengan peningkatan sumber daya manusia. Dan yang
terpenting lagi  dengan zakat produktif tidak terjadi sikap pembiaran terhadap fakir
miskin dan menjadikannya cara untuk menyelamatkan mustahik dari bahaya
kefakiran yang dapat menjadikan seorang menjadi kafir  sebagaimana diperkuat oleh
Hadits Nabi:
'1K AR CO LFN HR CO NJLFR N #L1O BR NADR'LN/'CN
Artinya: Kefakiran (kemiskinan) berakibat kepada kekafiran.
Dengan demikian  zakat produktif ini memiliki hikmah syari yang serupa
dengan hikmah zakat yaitu mensejahterakan kehidupan mustahik. Dengan zakat
produktif  status mustahik mampu berubah menjadi muzakki dengan potensi yang
dimilikinya; mustahik akan mampu memberdayakan dana zakat yang diterimanya
sebagai modal usaha yang pada akhirnya  ia pun akan menjadi pengusaha yang
sukses.
D. PENYALURAN ZAKAT UNTUK PEMBANGUNAN MASJID
Penjelasan tentang kelompok orang yang berhak menerima sudah cukup jelas
diinformasikan oleh al-Quran. Secara tekstual istilah masjid tidak terdapat dalam
kelompok yang delapan tersebut. inilah yang menimbulkan permasalahan apakah
zakat dapat disalurkan untuk pembangunan dan pemugaran masjid. Uraian berikut
24

mencoba untuk menjelaskan hukum penyaluran kepada sesuatu yang diluar asnaf
(kelompok mustahiq zakat tersebut).
1. Kelompok Mustahiq Zakat
Jumhur ulama sepakat bahwa kelompok mustahiq zakat itu terdiri delapan
asnaf atau bagian. Kesepakatan tersebut didasari oleh ayat al-Quran surat al-Taubat
ayat 60 sebagai berikut:
LFN JEP 1P 'N:DR 'LHN L(P 'NBL1 P D'LJPAHN LER GO O(HODOBL)P NAQN D$N EO DR 'HN L'GN JR DN 9N LFN JDPEP 'N9DR 'HN LFP JCP '3N EN DR 'HN L!P '1N NBOADR DPL*O 'NBN/5QN D'L'EN QNFP%
LE JCP -N LE JDP9N LO'DDQNQN HN LP'DDQNQN LFN EP LK )6N J1P NALDP JP(3QN D'LFP (R P'HN LP'DDQNQN LDP J(P 3N LJPAHN
Artinya: Shadaqah adalah hak untuk fakir  miskin  amil zakat  muallaf  budak  orang yang
terlilit hutang  di jalan Allah  dan orang yang dalam perjalanan (musafir). Sebagai
kewajiban yang datang dari Allah dan Allah Maha Mengetahui dan Maha Bijaksana.
(QS. at-Taubah: 60)
Delapan kelompok (mustahiq) zakat sebagaimana tercantum dalam ayat di atas 
penjelasannya sebagai berikut. Fuqara  yaitu Orang yang tidak memiliki harta dan
pekerjaan yang dapat memenuhi kebutuhannya sehari-hari. Orang yang termasuk
kelompok ini tidak memiliki suami (isteri)  ayah  ibu  dan anak yang dapat memenuhi
kebutuhan hidupnya. Masakin  yaitu Orang yang memiliki pekerjaan  tapi hasilnya
tidak dapat memenuhi kebutuhannya  Amilin yaitu Yaitu orang yang bekerja
memungut zakat (panitia zakat). Muallaf  pengertiannya dapat berarti orang yang
baru masuk Islam sedangkan imannya masih lemah  maka untuk menguatkannya
perlu diyakinkan dengan zakat. Atau orang kafir yang berniat untuk masuk Islam 
tapi masih tipis keimanannya  maka ia dapat diberi zakat supaya niat masuk Islamnya
menjadi kuat. Budak  yaitu orang yang hidupnya tidak merdeka  dikuasai oleh
tuannya dan berniat untuk membebaskan dirinya Orang yang terlilit hutang  yaitu
orang yang memiliki tunggakan hutang kepada orang lain baik hutang tersebut
untuk kepentingan pribadinya atau hutang karena untuk biaya kebajikan. Orang
yang berjuang di jalan Allah  yaitu para tentara yang berperang melawan serangan
orang kafir. Orang yang sedang dalam perjalanan. Yaitu orang yang sedang
melakukan sebuah perjalanan dengan tujuan yang baik bukan untuk kemaksiatan 
seperti pelajar atau mahasiswa yang belajar di luar negeri.
25

2. Hukum Zakat untuk Pembangunan Masjid
Seperti terungkap di muka  permasalahan yang muncul adalah  apa hukum
zakat untuk pembangunan masjid? Sebab dalam surat at-Taubah ayat 60 
sebagaimana dijelaskan di atas  pembangunan dan pemugaran mesjid tidak termasuk
ke dalam mustahiq zakat. Oleh karena itu  untuk menjawab pertanyaan di atas
diperlukan ijtihad yang dapat menentukan pintu masuk kepada kelompok mana
zakat untuk pembangunan masjid itu?
Di antara kedelapan macam mustahiq zakat seperti tersebut di atas  terdapat
mustahiq yang disebut sabilillah yang secara bahasa artinya jalan Allah. Para ulama
dalam memahami kata sabilillah tidak hanya terbatas pada makna hakiki yaitu para
pejuang yang berperang menegakkan agama Allah tapi memahaminya juga dari
makna majazi yang bersifat umum. Terkait dengan makna yang terakhir ini  para
ulama memiliki penafsiran yang beraneka ragam.
Menurut Mahmud Syaltut  istilah sabilillah memiliki arti kemaslahatan umat
yang manfaatnya kembali kepada kaum muslimin seperti pembangunan mesjid 
rumah sakit  perlengkapan pendidikan  dan sebagainya. Memperkuat pendapatnya 
Syaltut mengutip pendapat Imam Al-Razi yang mengatakan bahwa kata sabilillah
tidak terbatas pada arti tentara. Syaltut juga mengutip pendapat al-Qaffal yang
berpendapat bahwa boleh menyalurkan zakat ke semua bentuk kebaikan seperti
untuk mengurus mayat  membangun benteng  dan pembangunan masjid. Tetapi
Syaltut memberikan catatan bahwa zakat yang diperbolehkan untuk pembangunan
masjid dengan syarat masjid itu hanya satu-satunya di suatu desa  atau untuk
pembangunan masjid baru karena mesjid yang tersedia tidak cukup lagi untuk
menampung jamaah. Menurut Syaltut  arti sabilillah dapat disimpulkan menyangkut
pemeliharaan posisi materi dan spiritual suatu bangsa termasuk di dalamnya masjid.
Menurut al-Maraghi  istilah sabilillah adalah semua perkara yang berhubungan
dengan kemaslahatan ummat dapat dimasukkan ke dalam sabilillah  seperti perkara
yang menyangkut masalah agama dan pemerintahan  seperti masalah pelayanan haji.
26

M. Rasyid Ridha berpendapat bahwa  istilah sabilillah mencakup semua
kepentingan syariah secara umum yang berkenaan dengan masalah agama dan
negara dan yang terpenting  untuk persiapan kepentingan perang dengan membeli
persenjataan.
Menurut Yusuf Qardhawi  istilah sabilillah memiliki arti yang lentur  yaitu
semua sarana yang dapat dipergunakan untuk memperjuangkan kemajuan ummat
Islam dan melawan semua bentuk serangan orang-orang kafir  semuanya termasuk
sabilillah. Lebih rinci  beliau menyebutkan usaha pembebasan Islam dari kekuasaan
dengan memerangi kaum kafir  sarana pendidikan dan pengajaran serta lembaga
dakwah  surat kabar islami  penerbitan buku-buku islami dan para dai  semua yang
disebutkan di atas dapat dimasukkan ke dalam cakupan makna sabilillah.
Sayyid Sabiq berpendapat  bahwa istilah sabilillah adalah semua jalan yang
dapat menyampaikan kepada keridhaan Allah  baik berupa ilmu atau amal.
Mencermati pendapat-pendapat di atas  maka dapatlah disimpulkan bahwa
pengertian sabilillah secara umum dapat mencakup semua jalan kebaikan yang
manfaatnya kembali kepada umat Islam termasuk di dalamya adalah masjid 
penyebutan sarana ibadah yang disebutkan terakhir ini secara jelas disebut oleh
Mahmud Syaltut pada point pertama. Pengertian mazaj semacam ini dalam hukum
Islam dapat ditolerir selama tidak bertentangan dengan kaidah agama. Keberadaan
masjid dalam masyarakat memiliki peranan strategis  fungsinya bukan hanya sebagai
tempat sholat  tapi dapat dijadikan pusat pendidikan  dakwah  serta sosial
kemasyarakatan dalam rangka menegakkan agama Allah swt. Dengan demikian 
zakat boleh disalurkan untuk pembangunan masjid karena mesjid termasuk sabilillah
yang mengandung manfaat bagi umat Islam.
Selanjutnya menurut penulis  skala prioritas harus diutamakan. Terlebih
sekarang ini  keberadaan masjid di masyarakat begitu banyak dan pesat  sehingga
jarak masjid sangat berdekatan dan relatif jamaahnya di beberapa masjid ditemukan
sangat sedikit. Mengingat hal itu  penulis sejalan dengan Mahmud Syaltut yang
berpendapat bahwa penyaluran zakat untuk masjid itu harus diutamakan untuk
masjid baru yang dibangun karena masjid yang berdekatan sudah tidak mampu lagi
27

untuk menampung jamaah atau untuk agenda perluasan masjid karena daya
tampungnya tidak lagi mencukupi untuk menampung jamaah.
Terdapat fatwa MUI Nomor 001 Tahun 2015 tentang pendayagunaan dana
zakat  infaq  shadaqah dan wakaf untuk pengadaan sarana yang bermanfaat dan
mendesak untuk kemaslahatan masyarakat seperti sarana air bersih dan sanitasi.
Fatwa tersebut merupakan produk hukum baru terkait pendistribusian dana zakat.
Hal ini berlandaskan pengambilan maslahah demi kepentingan umat dan menghindari
kemudharatan yang telah terjadi di berbagai daerah. Tujuan utama kehadiran hukum
syari agar dijadikan pedoman utama dalam kehidupannya tidak lain agar manusia
meraih kebaikan (maslahah)  atau dengan kata lain untuk mewujudkan kemaslahatan
umat.
Contoh Soal
Zakat profesi merupakan zakat yang diwajibkan kepada umat islam. Sebab Islam
mengajarkan kepada umat manusia akan kesadaran bahwa harta ini hanya titipan dan
karunia dari Allah swt. Berikut ini pernyataan yang mendukung kewajiban zakat profesi
adalah
1. Zaman dahulu profesi hanya terbatas pada profesi perdagangan  pertanian  emas dan
perak  sehingga kewajiban harta terbatas pada profesi-profesi tersebut  sedangkan
zaman modern hari ini  pertanian sudah banyak ditinggalkan  orang lebih banyak
berprofesi sebagai pegawai dengan keahlian masing-masing. Ada yang insinyur 
dokter  guru dan lain sebagainya. Mereka pun mendapatkan rizki dari profesi yang
dilakukannya  maka mereka pun tetap punya kewajiban terhadap harta tersebut.
2. Pertanian  perdagangan  emas  perak merupakan profesi yang bernilai tinggi 
sedangkan profesi yang berkembang hari ini  hanya profesi yang bernilai rendah 
bahkan penghasilan profesinya banyak penipuan yang dilakukannya  sehingga tidak
ada kewajiban untuk membayarkan zakatnya.
3. Zakat itu untuk membersihkan jiwa dan harta. Dari mana pun harta yang kita hasilkan
hakikatnya adalah dari Allah swt. Untuk bisa membersihkan jiwa dan harta ini  maka
cara yang diajarkan oleh agama adalah mengeluarkan zakatnya.
28

4. Harta yang dikeluarkan untuk zakat haruslah yang bersih dan halal  sebab ia akan
menjadi pembersih  jika kotor yang digunakannya maka akan menjadi kotor badan
dan hartanya. Profesi di dunia modern ini banyak kotornya  dia banyak menipu
orang  banyak kezaliman kepada orang jadi tidak perlu ada kewajiban zakat profesi.
5. Manusia adalah makhluk sosial. Semua harta dan penghasilan yang diterima memuat
Sebagian kecil hak orang lain yang harus disalurkan. Zakat adalah salah satu cara
untuk membersihkan harta yang dimiliki dengan cara menyalurkannya kepada
mereka yang berhak menerimanya.
Diantara pernyataan yang mendukung kewajiban zakat profesi adalah&

A. Konsep Nikah dalam Islam
1. Syariat Pernikahan
Kedudukan nikah dalam Islam merupakan syariat yang terkandung didalamnya
nilai-nilai ibadah. Kelayakan manusia untuk menerima syariat tersebut paling tidak
diperkuat oleh tiga argumen. Pertama  manusia adalah makhluk berakal dan dengan akalnya
tersebut manusia mampu menerima dan menjalankan syariat dengan baik. Di antara syariat
tersebut adalah pernikahan  yang pengertiannya menurut ulama Syafiiyah  sebagai berikut:
 JH2*D'LH'L-'CFD%'L8AD(L!7HD'L)-'(%LFE6*JL/B9
(Akad (perjanjian) yang mengandung kebolehan hubungan kelamin dengan sebab lafaz nikah
atau tajwiz).
Kedua  manusia diciptakan oleh Allah berpasangan  yaitu laki-laki dan perempuan
sebagaimana dijelaskan oleh Allah swt:
LFN HEO DN 9R NJLD'N L'EQN EP HN LER GP 3P OAFRN #LFR EP HN L6O 1R N D#R 'L*O P(FRO*L'EQN EP L'GN QN DCO L N 'HN 2R N D#R 'LBN ND.N LJ0P QN D'LFN '-N (R 3O
Artinya: Maha Suci Tuhan yang telah menciptakan pasangan-pasangan semuanya  baik dari
apa yang ditumbuhkan oleh bumi dan dari diri mereka maupun dari apa yang tidak mereka
ketahui. (QS. Yasin: 36)
Dari kehidupan berpasangan  manusia disyariatkan untuk menjalin hubungan yang
mulia  mengembangkan keturunan  menegaskan hak dan kewajiban antara keduanya. Untuk
itu Allah menurunkan syariat yang bertujuan menjaga harkat dan martabat serta kehormatan
manusia yang disebut dengan nikah.
Ketiga  pernikahan dalam Islam disebut sebagai perilaku para Nabi dan
memasukkannya sebagai salah satu fitrah yang dimiliki oleh manusia. Rasulullah saw
bersabda empat fitrah yang dimiliki oleh manusia  yaitu memakai pacar  wangi-wangian 
bersiwak (gosok gigi)  dan nikah. (al-Hadis)
Untuk dijadikan sebuah perbandingan  sebelum pembahasan nikah menurut Islam
secara lebih mendalam perlu diungkap tentang pernikahan sebelum Islam (Jahiliyah). Pada
zaman Jahiliyah telah dikenal beberapa praktek perkawinan yang merupakan warisan turun
temurun dari perkawinan Romawi dan Persia. Pertama  perkawinan pacaran (khidn)  yaitu
berupa pergaulan bebas pria dan wanita sebelum perkawinan yang resmi dilangsungkan
33

yang tujuannya untuk mengetahui kepribadian masing-masing pasangan. Kedua  nikah badl 
yaitu seorang suami minta kepada laki-laki lain untuk saling menukar istrinya. Ketiga  nikah
istibdha  yaitu seorang suami minta kepada laki-laki kaya  bangsawan atau orang pandai agar
bersedia mengumpuli istrinya yang dalam keadaan suci sampai ia hamil. Setelah itu baru si
suami mengumpulinya. Keempat  nikah Raht (urunan)  seorang wanita dikumpuli oleh
beberapa pria sampai hamil. Ketika anaknya lahir  lalu wanita itu menunjuk salah satu pria
yang telah mengumpulinya untuk mengakui bayi yang telah dilahirkannya sebagai anaknya.
Nikah ini sama dengan nikah baghaaya (nikah pelacur).
Kehadiran Islam menghapus semua bentuk pernikahan di atas karena dipandang
tidak sejalan dengan naluriah dan kehormatan manusia serta dapat dikatakan cara binatang
yang tidak mengenal aturan. Nikah dalam syariat Islam diartikan sebagai sebuah akad yang
menghalalkan pergaulan dan membatasi hak dan kewajiban serta tolong menolong antara
laki-laki dan perempuan yang bukan mahramnya dengan rukun dan syarat yang telah
ditentukan. Al-Quran menyebut nikah sebagai mitsaq (perjanjian) antara suami dan isteri
sejak terjadinya akad. Hal ini dipahami karena keduanya berjanji untuk menjalankan hak dan
kewajiban masing-masing dengan sebaik-baiknya.
'8K JDP:N L'KB'N+JEP LER CO FR EP LFN 0R .N N #HN L6M 9R (N LINDP%LER CO 6O 9R (N LI6N AR N #L/R NBHN LOGNFHO0.O R #N*LAN JR CN HN
Artinya: Bagaimana kamu akan mengambilnya kembali  padahal sebagian kamu telah bergaul
(bercampur) dengan yang lain sebagai suami-isteri. Dan mereka (isteri-isterimu) telah mengambil
dari kamu perjanjian yang kuat. (QS. An-Nisa: 21)
Sepasang calon suami istri yang ingin melangsungkan ikatan pernikahan diharuskan
untuk memenuhi syarat dan rukun nikah. Terkait dengan rukun nikah  para ulama sepakat 
terdapat lima hal yang menjadi rukun nikah. calon suami istri  Wali dari calon isteri  dua
orang saksi  Mahar (mas kawin)  dan Ijab-qabul.
2. Hikmah atau Tujuan Nikah
Setiap syariat yang diturunkan oleh Allah dipastikan terdapat hikmah untuk
kehidupan manusia. Sedikitnya terdapat lima point penting yang penulis kutip dari
pendapat Sayyid Sabiq dalam kitabnya Fiqh Sunnah berkaitan dengan hikmah dari sebuah
pernikahan.
a. Nafsu seks termasuk tuntutan terkuat dan selalu meliputi kehidupan manusia. Ketika
tidak ada jalan keluar untuk melampiaskan  maka manusia akan dirundung
34

kegelisahan dan dikhawatirkan melakukan prostitusi (perzinahan). Maka pernikahan
merupakan aturan yang paling baik dan jalan keluar yang menyejukkan untuk
memuaskan seks manusia. Dengan nikah jasad menjadi segar  jiwa menjadi tentram
dan penglihatan akan menutupi sesuatu yang diharamkan. Ini semua terkandung dari
petunjuk Allah dalam firmanNya:
LJPALFQN P%LK )EN -R 1N HN LK)QN/HN EN LER CO FN JR (N LDN 9N L N HN L'GN JR NDP%L'HOFCO 3R N*DPL' K 'HN 2R N #LER CO 3P OAFRN #LFR EP LER CO NDLBN ND.N LFR N #LGP P*'NJ'!N LFR EP HN
LFN H1O CQN AN N*JN LEM HR NBDPL*M 'NJDNN LCN DPN0
Artinya: Dan di antara tanda-tanda kekuasaan-Nya ialah Dia menciptakan untukmu isteri-isteri
dari jenismu sendiri  supaya kamu cenderung dan merasa tenteram kepadanya  dan dijadikan-Nya
di antaramu rasa kasih dan sayang. Sesungguhnya pada yang demikian itu benar-benar terdapat
tanda-tanda bagi kaum yang berfikir. (QS. ar-Rum: 21)
b. Pernikahan jalan terbaik untuk melahirkan anak  memperbanyak kelahiran dan
melestarikan kehidupan dengan selalu menjaga keturunan.
c. Naluri kebapakan dan keibuan akan tumbuh dan berkembang dalam menaungi anak
masa kanak-kanak serta tumbuhnya rasa kasih-sayang. Semua kelebihan itu tidak
akan sempurna tanpa adanya tali pernikahan.
d. Rasa tanggung jawab dari pernikahan serta mengurus anak dapat membangkitkan
semangat dan mencurahkan segala kemampuan dalam memperkuat potensi diri.
Maka bangkitlah untuk bekerja dengan segala kewajiban sehingga banyak kesibukan
yang dapat menambah harta  kesuksesan dan tergugah semangat untuk
mengeluarkan kekayaan alam dan yang terpendam di dalamnya.
e. Membagi-bagi pekerjaan dan membatasi tanggung jawab pekerjaan kepada suami
dan isteri. Isteri mengurus rumah  hingga tertata dengan rapih  mendidik anak dan
mempersiapkan udara segar untuk suami agar dapat beristirahat yang dapat
menghilangkan kelelahannya dan menimbulkan semangat baru yang dapat
membangkitkan semangat kerja untuk memperoleh harta dan nafkah yang
dibutuhkan. Pembagian kerja yang adil terhadap suami istri sesuai dengan tugas
alamiah mereka masing-masing ini akan diridhai oleh Allah dan pujian manusia serta
menghasilkan buah yang diberkahi.
35

3. Hukum Pernikahan
Penetapan hukum nikah termasuk perkara yang selalu dikaitkan dengan kondisi
orang yang akan melakukannya. Dengan demikian kondisi tersebut dapat dijadikan sebagai
illat hukumnya. Hal yang dapat dimaklumi bahwa kondisi seseorang itu berbeda antara
yang satu dengan yang lainnya jika dilihat dari aspek gejolak seks dan kemampuan
pemberian nafkah. Berangkat dari perbedaan kondisi tersebut maka para ulama
menghukumi nikah itu sesuai dengan illat (sebab) yang ditemui dari seseorang yang akan
melangsungkan pernikahan. Memperhatikan berbagai macam illat nikah maka hukum nikah
dapat ditetapkan sebagai berikut:
a. Wajib  hukum ini layak dibebankan kepada orang yang telah mampu memberi nafkah 
jiwanya terpanggil untuk nikah dan jika tidak nikah khawatir terjerumus ke lembah
perzinahan. Hal ini diperkuat oleh tuntunan agama bahwa menjaga diri dari perbuatan
haram adalah wajib. Sedangkan bagi yang hanya memiliki keinginan yang kuat tapi
belum mampu memberi nafkah  maka lebih baik ia menahan diri. Hal ini didasari oleh
firman Allah swt:
LGP DP6R NALFR EP LO'DDQNLQN LEO GO NJFP :R OJLIQN*-N L'-K 'CN FP LFN HO/NP NJLD'N LFN J0P QN D'LAP AP 9R N*3R NJDR HN
Artinya: Dan orang-orang yang tidak mampu kawin hendaklah menjaga kesucian (diri) nya 
sehingga Allah memampukan mereka dengan karunia-Nya. (QS. An-Nuur: 33)
Salah satu cara untuk menjaga diri ketika gejolak nafsu biologis yang memuncak bagi
orang yang belum layak nikah karena belum mampu menafkahi seperti tersebut di atas.
disarankan agar ia memperbanyak puasa. Hal ini diperkuat oleh Hadits Rasulullah saw
berikut ini:
L P 1R NADR DPLFO 5N -R N'HN L1P 5N N(DR DPL6QO :N N #LOGQNF'P NAL R HQN 2N NL*NJDRNALN)!N 'N(DR'LEO CO FR EP L9N '7N N*3R 'LFP EN L(P 'N(4QN D'L1N 4N 9R EN L'NJ
(I1'.(D'LG'H1)L! ' N HP LOGNDLOGQNF'P NALEP HR 5QN D'P(LGP JR NDN9AN L9R 7P N*3R NJLER NDLFR EN HN
Artinya: Hai para pemuda  siapa diantara kalian yang sudah mampu untuk menikah  maka
menikahlah  karena nikah dapat menahan pandangan dari maksiat dan dapat menjaga
kemaluan dari berbuat zina. Namun bagi siapa yang belum mampu hendaklah ia berpuasa
karena puasa dapat membentengi dorongan sahwat. (HR. Bukhari)
36

b. Sunah  hukum ini pantas bagi orang yang merindukan pernikahan dan mampu memberi
nafkah tapi sebenarnya ia masih mampu menahan dirinya dari perbuatan zina. Maka
bagi orang seperti ini hukum nikah menjadi sunah. Akan tetapi jika demikian kondisinya 
nikah lebih baik baginya dari pada membujang karena dalam nikah terdapat ibadah yang
banyak. Sedangkan membujang (tidak nikah) itu seperti para pendeta Nasrani yang
dilarang oleh Rasulullah.
I1N '5N QNFD'L)P QNJFP 'N(GR 1O CN L'HR OFHR CO N*LND'HN LEO EN OD'R'LEO CO (P L1 +'P CN EO LI PF'P NAL'HR  O HQN 2N N*
Artinya: Nikahlah kamu sekalian karena aku akan berbanyak-banyak umat pada hari Qiamat
dan janganlah kamu seperti pendeta Nasrani.
Memperkuat anjuran nikah  Umar pernah berkata kepada Abi Zawaid  hanya sifat lemah
atau melacurlah yang mencegahmu dari nikah. Berkata juga Ibnu Abbas bahwa tidak
akan sempurna ibadah seseorang sampai ia menikah.
c. Haram  hukum ini layak bagi orang yang tidak mampu memberikan nafkah dan jika ia
memaksakan diri untuk menikah akan mengkhianati isterinya atau suaminya  baik
dalam pemberian nafkah lahiriyah maupun batiniyah  sehingga dengan perkawinan itu
hak-hak istri/suami tidak terpenuhi.
B. Pernikahan Monogami dalam Ajaran Islam
1. Pengertian Monogami
Dalam kamus bahasa Indonesia  monogami berarti sistem yang hanya
memperbolehkan seorang laki-laki mempunyai satu isteri pada jangka waktu tertentu. Dari
tarif atau definisi tersebut dapat dipahami bahwa seorang suami yang beristerikan satu isteri
saja tidak dua atau tiga maka suami itu menganut monogami.
Asas monogami telah ditetapkan oleh Islam sejak lima belas abad yang lalu sebagai
salah satu asas perkawinan dalam Islam. Tujuannya untuk memberikan landasan dan modal
utama dalam pembinaan kehidupan rumah tangga yang harmonis  sejahtera dan bahagia.
Oleh karena itu hukum asal perkawinan dalam Islam adalah monogami. Hukum ini sangatlah
beralasan karena dengan monogami tujuan pernikahan untuk menghantarkan keluarga
bahagia akan lebih mudah karena tidak terlalu banyak beban. Selain dengan bermonogami
juga akan lebih mudah untuk menetralisir dan meredam sifat cemburu  iri hati dan perasaan
mengeluh dalam kehidupan isteri sehari-hari. Islam memerintahkan kepada laki-laki untuk
37

nikah dengan seorang perempuan yang dicintainya. Bagi laki-laki  selayaknya sikap
monogami ini jika tidak ada alasan yang dapat dibenarkan untuk beristeri lebih dari satu 
seperti si isteri ternyata mandul.
2. Dalil dan Hukum Asal Pernikahan Monogami
Pada asalnya hukum Islam menetapkan kepada laki-laki untuk beristeri satu saja.
Isyarat al-Quran untuk bermonogami bagi laki-laki dapat kita pahami dari berbagai ayat al-
Quran yang memerintahkan kepada laki-laki untuk menikah jika sudah mampu  sikap
membujang berkepanjangan tanpa alasan adalah sikap yang tidak dibenarkan karena dalam
nikah banyak terdapat kebaikan. Hal ini dapat dilihat dalam al-Quran antara lain:
LGP DP6R NALLFR EP LO'DDQNLQN LEO GP PF:R OJL!N '1N NBOAL'HOFHCO JN LFR P%LER CO P&'EN %P HN LER CO /P 'N(9P LFR EP LFN J-P DP'5QN D'HN LER CO FR EP LIEN 'NJN D#R 'L'H-O CP FRN #HN
LE JDP9N L9 3P 'HN LO'DDQNQN HN
Artinya: Dan kawinkanlah orang-orang yang sendirian di antara kamu  dan orang-orang yang
layak (berkawin) dari hamba-hamba sahayamu yang lelaki dan hamba-hamba sahayamu yang
perempuan. Jika mereka miskin Allah akan memampukan mereka dengan kurnia-Nya. Dan Allah
Maha Luas (pemberian-Nya) Lagi Maha Mengetahui. (QS. An-Nur 32).
Adapun dasar hukum monogami dalam Islam adalah al-Quran yang menjelaskan
tentang kewajiban berperilaku adil terhadap seorang istri  dan jika khawatir tidak mampu
berperilaku adil maka wajib monogami. Bahkan secara tegas bahwa Allah menyatakan bahwa
para suami tidak akan mampu berbuat adil kepada istri mereka. Hal ini sebagaimana
dijelaskan dalam firman Allah swt berikut ini:

memelihara diri (dari kecurangan) maka sesungguhnya Allah Maha Pengampun lagi Maha
Penyayang. [Q.S. an-Nisa (4): 129].
Menurut Yusuf Qardhawi  Islam adalah agama yang sejalan dengan fitrah manusia;
mengakui fakta yang dapat membimbing dan menjauhkan manusia dari perbuatan bodoh.
Sebelum Islam datang  agama-agama terdahulu telah membolehkan praktek poligami sampai
seratus isteri tanpa terikat oleh syarat dan aturan. Itulah kultur yang terjadi di masyarakat
dahulu. Islam datang tidak menghapus secara serta merta sistem poligami Jahiliyah  yang
sudah mendarah daging namun membangun aturan poligami; penerapan pembatasan
jumlah istri tidak boleh lebih dari empat di samping adanya syarat-syarat lain yang
berhubungan dengan keadilan.
Islam turun di tengah-tengah masyarakat jahiliyah dalam kondisi poligami yang
berlebihan dan agar Islam diterima oleh mereka pada saat itu  maka Islam membolehkan
praktik menikah dengan batasan empat orang istri. Dengan demikian  hukum asal
pernikahan dalam Islam adalah monogami. Sebab syarat keadilan menjadi syarat berat bagi
setiap suami yang akan melaksanakan pernikahan lebih dari seorang istri.
C. Poligami dalam Ajaran Islam
1. Pengertian dan Hukum Poligami
Secara kebahasaan yang lebih tepat adalah poligini yang dalam kamus bahasa
Indonesia diartikan sebagai Sistem perkawinan yang membolehkan seorang pria memiliki
beberapa wanita sebagai isterinya di waktu yang bersamaan. Namun dalam tulisan ini 
selanjutnya penulis cenderung untuk menggunakan istilah poligami untuk pembahasan
dimaksud  yaitu poligami yang bermakna pologini (suami beristeri lebih dari satu) karena
selain bisa dibenarkan secara kebahasaan juga istilah tersebut sudah populer penyebutannya
di masyarakat untuk laki-laki yang beristeri lebih dari satu.
Di masyarakat seperti sekarang ini  sikap berpoligami bagi sebagian laki-laki seakan
menjadi sesuatu yang dianggap mudah untuk dilakukan karena hanya semata mengikuti
nafsu biologis dan tidak mengikuti aturan yang sebenarnya. Memang Pada asalnya hukum
poligami itu diperbolehkan jika seseorang suami tidak dikhawatirkan berbuat zhalim
terhadap isteri-isterinya. Jika dipastikan akan berlaku zhalim  maka seorang suami lebih baik
untuk beristeri satu saja.
39

Islam diperuntukan untuk semua jenis dan golongan manusia serta memelihara
kepentingan dan kemashlahatan yang bersifat pribadi dan umum. Kebolehan poligami untuk
mewujudkan kemashlahatan bagi manusia agar tidak berlaku zina dan tidak terjatuh ke dalam
pintu kemaksiatan. Dengan kata lain menurut Mahmud Syaltut  bahwa pada asalnya Islam
memerintahkan laki-laki untuk beristeri satu  boleh beristeri lebih dari satu jika dipandang
darurat.
Yusuf Qardhawi menjelaskan kondisi darurat yang dengannya seorang laki-laki
dibolehkan berpoligami adalah sebagai berikut: pertama  ditemukan seorang suami yang
menginginkan keturunan  akan tetapi ternyata isterinya tidak dapat melahirkan anak
disebabkan karena mandul atau penyakit. Kedua  Di antara suami ada yang memiliki
overseks  akan tetapi isterinya memiliki kelemahan seks  memiliki penyakit atau masa
haidhnya terlalu panjang sedangkan suaminya tidak sabar menghadapi kelemahan isterinya
tersebut. Ketiga  jumlah wanita lebih banyak dibanding jumlah laki-laki  khususnya setelah
terjadi peperangan. Di situ terdapat kemaslahatan yang harus didapat oleh sebuah
masyarakat dan para wanita yang tidak menginginkan hidup tanpa suami dan keinginan
hidup tenang  cinta dan terlindungi serta menikmati sifat keibuan.
Namun permasalahan yang harus dihadapi bahwa kebolehan seorang suami untuk
beristeri lebih dari satu bukan hanya dikarenakan kondisi mendesak sebagaimana tersebut di
atas. Katakanlah itu adalah pasal yang harus dimiliki oleh seorang suami sebelum
berpoligami. Namun ada pasal penting lainnya yang wajib dipenuhi setelah poligami itu
terealisasi yaitu seorang suami harus berlaku adil dalam memberikan nafkah. Kewajiban bagi
seorang suami untuk berlaku adil dalam memberikan nafkah terhadap isteri-isterinya adalah
konsekuensi dari tindakan berpoligami dalam Islam. Sikap adil dimaksud berarti seorang
suami dapat memenuhi hak kewajibannya terhadap isteri-isterinya secara proporsional
sesuai dengan kebutuhan secara wajar.
Nafkah itu ada yang bersifat lahiriyah  yaitu nafkah yang bersifat materi dan
immateri (batiniyah). Sehubungan dengan pembagian nafkah tersebut maka keadilan pun
terbagi menjadi dua yaitu keadilan dalam memberikan nafkah lahiriyah dan keadilan dalam
memberikan nafkah batiniyah. Pada keadilan bentuk pertama  seorang suami dituntut untuk
berlaku adil terhadap isteri-isterinya dalam memberikan makan  minum  pakaian  rumah 
serta waktu giliran. Pemenuhan rasa keadilan bentuk pertama ini sangat mungkin dapat
dilakukan oleh seorang suami terhadap isteri-isterinya. Maka jika seorang suami tidak dapat
40

berlaku adil dalam nafkah lahir ini yang mengakibatkan isteri-isteri terzalimi  maka haram
bagi laki-laki untuk berpoligami. Allah swt berfirman dalam al-Quran surat al-Nisa ayat 3:
L*R CN NDEN L'LEN LHR N L#LK)N/-P 'HN NAL'HOD/P 9R N*LD'QN N #LER O*AR .P LFR P%NAL9N 'N(1O HN L+N D'N O+HN LINFR +EN L!P '3N PFD'LFN EP LER CO NDL(N '7N L'EN L'H-O CP FR 'NA

Artinya: Kawinilah wanita-wanita (lain) yang kamu senangi: dua  tiga atau empat. Kemudian
jika kamu takut tidak akan dapat berlaku adil  maka (kawinilah) seorang saja  atau budak-budak
yang kamu miliki. Yang demikian itu adalah lebih dekat kepada tidak berbuat aniaya.
Rasulullah bersabda:

Artinya: Siapa yang memiliki dua orang isteri tapi ia lebih berpihak kepada salah satunya  maka
pada hari kiamat ia berjalan dalam keadaan menarik salah satu pundaknya (miring). (HR. Abu
Daud)
Adapun sesuatu yang dianggap perbuatan menzalimi dalam Hadits di atas adalah
ketidak-adilan seorang suami dalam memenuhi hak-hak isteri yang dipandang kuasa bagi
suami untuk memenuhinya seperti nafkah lahir dan waktu gilir.
Terkait dengan keadilan bentuk kedua yakni keadilan yang bersifat batin (LJQO P(DRNBDR'LDO JREN DRN') 
kecenderungan hati/cinta. Usaha untuk berlaku adil dalam membagi cinta kepada isteri-isteri
inilah yang sesungguhnya sangat berat bagi seorang suami. Dan hal ini sudah bisa dipastikan
tidak dapat dilakukan oleh suami untuk berlaku adil sebagaimana diisyaratkan oleh al-
Quran:
L)P NBQN DLN9LEO DR 'CN L'GN H1O N0N*NALDP JR EN DR 'LDQN CO L'HODJEP N*LD'N NALER O*5R 1N -N LHR NDHN L!P '3N PFD'LFN JR (N L'HOD/P 9R N*LFR N #L'HO9J7P N*3R N*LFR NDHN
'EK J-P 1N L'1K HOA:N LFN 'CN LN'DDQNQN LFQN P%NAL'HOBQN*N*HN L'H-O DP5R O*LFR P%HN
Artinya: Dan kamu sekali-kali tidak akan dapat berlaku adil di antara isteri- isteri (mu)  walaupun
kamu sangat ingin berbuat demikian  karena itu janganlah kamu terlalu cenderung (kepada yang
kamu cintai)  sehingga kamu biarkan yang lain terkatung-katung. Dan jika kamu mengadakan
perbaikan dan memelihara diri (dari kecurangan)  maka sesungguhnya Allah Maha Pengampun
lagi Maha Penyayang. (QS. an-Nisa:129)
Kalau seandainya keadilan membagi cinta ini menjadi syarat yang mutlak bagi
seorang suami  maka tertutup hukum kebolehan bagi seorang suami untuk berpoligami
41

meskipun sudah berada pada kondisi yang darurat. Oleh karena sulitnya berlaku adil dalam
membagi cinta  maka Menurut Yusuf Qardhawi ini adalah keadilan yang dimaafkan dan
diberikan toleransi  namun tidak termaafkan untuk nafkah lahir.
Ayat ini juga dapat dipahami bahwa seorang suami yang berpoligami tidak hanya
untuk berkomitmen untuk adil  karena ayat tersebut memastikan bahwa siapapun seorang
suami tidak akan pernah bisa berbuat adil kepada isteri-isterinya  karena itu penting
keharusan adanya maslahat yang lebih besar untuk isteri-isteri dan anak-anaknya. Perhatikan
bagaimana tingginya konflik berumah tangga bagi para suami yang beristeri lebih dari satu 
perseteruan antara para isteri  kecemburuan buta  permusuhan antara para anak  perebutan
harta waris dan dosa-dosa yang ditimbulkan akibat perilaku berpoligami. Karena itu 
pikirkan kemaslahatan yang lebih penting jika melakukan poligami seperti untuk
kepentingan dakwah  mendapatkan keturunan hebat  dan kemaslahatan buat seluruh
anggota keluarganya.
Contoh praktik poligami ideal adalah Baginda Rasulullah saw yang selalu berusaha
untuk berlaku adil sampai kepada masalah bepergian dan untuk memenuhi rasa keadilan
tersebut  Rasulullah mengundi di antara isteri-isterinya. Bagi yang keluar undiannya  maka
dialah yang menjadi teman pergi Rasulullah  hal ini dilakukan oleh Rasulullah supaya tidak
melukai perasaan dan meminta kerelaan dari isteri-isteri yang tidak pergi bersama Rasul.
Bukan hanya itu  Beliau berpoligami hanya semata untuk kepentingan dakwah sebab istri-
istri yang dinikahi oleh beliau adalah wanita-wanita yang sangat memerlukan bantuan 
lihatlah sosok wanita yang beliau nikahi semuanya adalah janda kecuali Sayyidatina Aisyah
r.a.
Meskipun poligami diizinkan dalam ajaran Islam dengan syarat-syarat ketat  tetapi
realitasnya ternyata menyisakan penderitaan bagi istri  orang tua dan anak-anak. Hancurnya
rumah tangga dan putusnya cinta kasih di antara mereka  bahkan anak yang tidak berdosa
pun sering menjadi korban. Karena itu  poligami hendaknya dihindari oleh setiap suami 
sebab mengandung kemudharatan bagi setiap anggota keluarga. Hal ini terungkap dalam
hadis Nabi SAW Riwayat Imam al-Bukhari  Muslim  Turmudzi dan Ibnu Majah dari Miswar
bin Makhramah yang mengangkat peristiwa yang dialami keluarga putri Nabi SAW
(Fatimah) ketika Ali akan melakukan poligami.
Miswar bin Makhramah bercerita bahwa ia mendengar Rasulullah SAW berdiri di atas
mimbar seraya berkata  Sesungguhnya keluarga Hisyam bin al-Mughirah meminta izinku untuk
42

menikahkan putrinya dengan Ali bin Abi Thalib. Aku tidak izinkan. Aku tidak izinkan. Aku tidak
izinkan. Kecuali jika Ali bin Abi Thalib lebih memilih menceraikan putriku dan menikah dengan
putrinya (Keluarga Hisyam). Sesungguhnya putriku adalah darah dagingku  menyusahkannya berarti
menyusahkanku dan menyakitinya berarti menyakitiku [H.R. al-Bukhari  Muslim  at-Turmudzi
dan Ibnu Majah].
Hadits di atas mempertegas prinsip monogami dalam pernikahan. Nabi SAW
melarang Ali bin Abi Thalib untuk melakukan poligami  bahkan beliau meminta Ali memilih
menceraikan Fatimah putri Nabi jika tetap menikahi gadis tersebut. Alasan yang diajukan
Rasulullah adalah beliau tidak rela andaikan poligami itu akan menyusahkan dan menyakiti
putri tercintanya Fatimah  yang berarti menyakiti perasaan Rasulullah SAW sebagai ayahnya.
Jika kedua kelompok hadis di atas digabungkan  dapat dipahami bahwa hadis-hadis
tentang poligami tidak menyebutkan bahwa poligami itu perbuatan sunah atau yang
dianjurkan. Poligami dalam Islam merupakan ketentuan pembatasan yang pernah terjadi
sebelumnya (yang tidak terbatas). Poligami dilakukan dengan memenuhi ketentuan adil.
2. Hikmah dari Poligami
Berpoligami bagi sebagian orang terkadang tidak terlalu sulit untuk dilakukan.
Permasalahannya adalah tidak mudah untuk berlaku adil dalam memenuhi sesuatu yang
menjadi hak para isteri. Terlihat  banyak suami yang beristeri lebih dari satu tapi sebenarnya
mereka tidak mampu untuk memberikan nafkah. Motif mereka berpoligami bukan karena
masalah darurat  tapi karena ingin memperturutkan hawa nafsu seksual. Kalaupun mereka
mampu memberikan nafkah namun terkadang perlakuan suami kepada isteri-isterinya
banyak berlaku tidak adil dalam pemenuhan kebutuhan seperti makan  pakaian  tempat
tinggal  dan waktu bergilir.
Oleh karena itu  alasan kebolehan berpoligami bagi sang suami dikarenakan terdapat
kondisi darurat dan syarat berlaku adil terdapat hikmah di dalamnya. Rasyid Ridha
mengemukakan empat hikmah. 1) Untuk mendapatkan anak bagi suami yang subur dan
isteri yang mandul. 2). Menjaga keutuhan keluarga tanpa harus mencerai isteri pertama meski
ia tidak berfungsi semestinya sebagai isteri karena cacat fisik dan sebagainya. 3). Untuk
menyelamatkan suami yang hiperseks dari perbuatan free sex. Tercatat di beberapa negara
Barat yang melarang poligami mengakibatkan merajalelanya praktek prostitusi dan free sex
(kumpul kebo) dan lahirnya anak-zina yang mencapai jumlah cukup tinggi. 4).
43

Menyelamatkan harkat dan martabat wanita dari krisis akhlak (melacur)  terutama bagi
mereka yang tinggal di negara yang jumlah wanitanya lebih banyak dibanding laki-laki
akibat peperangan misalnya.
Sedangkan hikmah kebolehan Rasulullah beristeri lebih dari empat bukanlah karena
dorongan hawa nafsu sebagaimana yang dituduhkan oleh kaum orientalis  tapi mengandung
hikmah yang besar  yaitu kepentingan dakwah Islam sebagaimana dikemukakan oleh Abbas
Mahmud al-Aqqad sebagai berikut:
a. Untuk kepentingan pendidikan dan pengajaran agama. Semua isteri Nabi yang
berjumlah sembilan dapat dijadikan sumber informasi bagi umat Islam yang hendak
mengetahui ajaran-ajaran Nabi dan praktek kehidupan beliau dalam berkeluarga 
bermasyarakat  terutama masalah rumah tangga.
b. Untuk kepentingan politik  yaitu mempersatukan suku-suku bangsa Arab dan sekaligus
menarik mereka masuk Islam. Seperti perkawinan Nabi dengan Juwairiyah putri al-Harist
kepala suku bani al-Musthaliq dan Shafiyah  seorang tokoh dari Bani Quiraizhah dan Bani
al-Nadhir.
c. Untuk kepentingan sosial dan kamanusiaan. Seperti perkawinan beliau dengan janda
dermawan bernama Khadijah dan janda pahlawan Islam seperti Saudah binti Zumaah
(suaminya meninggal setelah kembali dari hijrah ke Abesenia)  Hafsah binti Umar
(suaminya gugur pada perang badar)  Hindun Ummu Salamah (suaminya gugur di
perang Uhud).
Seandainya saja motif Rasul untuk menikah lebih dari satu karena dorongan sex 
mungkin wanita yang dinikahi adalah gadis-gadis cantik bangsa Arab. Tetapi hal itu sama
sekali tidak dilakukan oleh Rasulullah tapi justru dengan Siti khadijah yang umurnya lebih
tua 15 tahun dibandingkan umur beliau. Demikian dengan isteri-isteri beliau yang lain 
semuanya dinikahi bukan karena tuntutan nafsu  tapi bermotif dakwah yang ternyata motif
tersebut dapat membantu keberhasilan tugas beliau sebagai utusan Allah. Dengan demikian 
pada pernikahan Rasul terdapat hikmah yang tinggi yang bernilai dakwah  pendidikan dan
sosial kemasyarakatan. Argumentasi logis di atas dapat meruntuhkan segala tuduhan
negatif yang dilontarkan oleh kaum orientalis terhadap kebolehan rasul bersiteri lebih dari
satu.
44

Lebih lanjut Al-Jarjawi menguraikan pula hikmah pembatasan poligami sampai
empat orang istri  yaitu: pertama  jumlah empat istri merupakan kompilasi dari empat unsur
bumi dan merupakan simbol atas kesinambungan spesies manusia. Kedua  jumlah empat
sesuai dengan sumber nafkah yakni kepemimpinan  perdagangan  pertanian dan industri.
Ketiga  empat adalah jumlah pembagian cuaca dalam setahun  pergantian yang memperbaiki
semua sendi kehidupan manusia  kehidupan tumbuhan  dan kehidupan binatang. Keempat 
empat orang istri dianggap cukup untuk mendapatkan setiap mereka satu hari kemudian
menanti dalam rentang waktu tiga hari lainnya. Rentang waktu tiga hari ini dirasa cukup
untuk menumbuhkan kerinduan dan kasih sayang. Seorang istri tidak bisa menanti lebih dari
waktu tersebut. Kelima  sesungguhnya syariat menjadikan jumlah tiga sebagai tambahan
karena ia sudah menjadi satu standarisasi umum dalam banyak hukum di berbagai negara.
Poligami dengan batasan empat orang istri memang diperbolehkan oleh syariat
Muhammad tetapi dengan syarat berlaku adil kepada semua istrinya. Tetapi waspadalah 
Ketika suami tidak mampu memberikan hak yang sama pada setiap istrinya  maka
terkoyaklah urusan rumah tangganya dan buruklah bahtera rumah tangganya pada akhirnya
akan membawa permasalahan besar bagi setiap anggota keluarganya. Para istri pun
disibukkan dengan pertengkaran antara mereka  memperebutkan harta suaminya  sehingga
melupakan kewajiban mereka untuk mengatur rumah tangga. Itulah aspek-aspek yang
menjadi pertimbangan seorang berpoligami. Karena itulah surat an-Nisa ayat 3 secara tegas
&.Kemudian jika kamu takut tidak akan dapat berlaku adil  maka kawinilah seorang saja.
(QS. An-Nisa:3).
D. Konsep Nikah Mutah
Semarak nikah mutah atau sering disebut dengan nikah kontrak nampaknya masih
menghiasi kehidupan sebagian kecil masyarakat. Keprihatinan dan kekhawatiran pun
muncul dari orang tua  tokoh masyarakat  pendidik bahkan ulama terhadap pernikahan yang
terkesan main-main ini. Praktek nikah mutah seperti tersebut terjadi selain karena terdapat
legitimasi dari kelompok yang membolehkan  juga ditemukan alasan untuk terhindar dari
perzinahan demi memenuhi tuntutan sex sesaat. Untuk dapat menguji keabsahan nikah
mutah yang banyak dilakukan oleh orang yang tinggal jauh dari isterinya karena memenuhi
45

tugas kerja misalnya  bahkan tak luput pelakunya adalah pemuda dan mahasiswa  berikut
ini akan dijelaskan tentang hukum nikah mutah.
1. Pengertian dan Dasar Nikah Mutah.
Kata mutah ( L)N9R*EO )  berasal dari bahasa Arab yang mempunyai arti antara lain bekal
yang sedikit dan barang yang menyenangkan. Pengertian ini sejalan dengan kata mutah yang
terdapat dalam al-Quran yang berarti bercampur (bersenang-senang bersama istri dengan
bersenggama) dan pemberian yang menyenangkan oleh suami kepada isterinya yang dicerai.
Firman Allah swt:
L'9K 'N*EN LOG1O N/NBL1P P*LBREO DR'LIND9N HNL1O N/NBL P93P HEO DR'LINDL9N LFQN GO HO9 P*EN HNLK)6N J1P NALFQN GO NDL'H6O 1P ARN*LHRN#LFQN GO H3QO EN N*LERNDL'EN L!N '3N P FD'LEOO*BRQND7N LFR P%LERCO JRND9N L-N 'NF O LD'N
(232)LFN JPF3P -R EO DR'LIND9N L'QKB-N LAP H1O 9R EN DR'P(
Artinya: Tidak ada kewajiban membayar (mahar) atas kamu  jika kamu menceraikan isteri-
isterimu sebelum kamu bercampur dengan mereka dan sebelum kamu menentukan maharnya. Dan
hendaklah kamu berikan suatu mut`ah (pemberian) kepada mereka. Orang yang mampu menurut
kemampuannya dan orang yang miskin menurut kemampuannya (pula)  yaitu pemberian menurut
yang patut. Yang demikian itu merupakan ketentuan bagi orang-orang yang berbuat kebajikan.
(QS. Al-Baqarah: 236)
Yusuf Qardhawi memberikan pengertian nikah mutah secara terminologi  yaitu
seorang laki-laki mengikat (menikahi) seorang perempuan untuk waktu yang ditentukan
dengan imbalan uang yang tertentu pula. Di Indonesia  kawin mutah ini popular dengan
sebutan kawin kontrak.
Uraian di atas memberikan gambaran cukup jelas tentang nikah mutah. Bahwa
tidaklah nikah mutah itu dilakukan  kecuali kecenderungan seseorang untuk memenuhi
kebutuhan seksual  berakhir tanpa talak (cerai) karena secara otomatis jika sudah habis waktu
kontrak yang telah ditentukan maka berakhir lah riwayat pernikahan itu. Dilihat dari
penetapan pembatasan waktu (taqit) tersebut  pernikahan semacam itu bertentangan
dengan syariat Islam yang menghendaki pernikahan itu tidak terbatas oleh waktu.
2. Hukum Nikah Mutah
Nikah mutah pada zaman Nabi diperbolehkan namun tidak berlaku untuk semua
orang hanya untuk orang tertentu dikarenakan terdapat suatu kondisi yang sangat mendesak.
Menurut Yusuf Qardhawi  rahasia diperbolehkan nikah mutah pertama kali pada zaman
Nabi  karena umat ketika itu berada pada masa transisi dari dunia Jahiliyah ke dunia Islam.
46

Pada zaman Jahiliyah  perzinahan merupakan budaya yang sudah menyebar luas. Ketika
Islam mewajibkan kepada kaum untuk pergi berjihad  mereka merasakan sangat berat tinggal
jauh dengan isteri-isteri mereka. Di antara kaum yang ikut berijihad dengan Rosulullah itu
ada yang memiliki iman yang kuat dan ada yang lemah. Mereka yang lemah imannya sangat
takut terjerumus ke jurang perzinahan. Sedangkan mereka yang kuat imannya bersikeras
untuk menghilangkan nafsu seksnya dengan cara mengebiri  sebagaimana informasi Hadits
yang diriwayatkan oleh Ibnu masud:
L(P LHRQN+D'P(LN)N#1R EN DR'L-N CP FRNFLLLLLLLFR N#L'NFNDLL5N .QN 1N HNLCN DPNL'0LFR 9N LP'DDGLDO HR3O 1N L'NF'GN NFNALJN 5P .R N*3R NFLQND'N#L'NFDROBNAL! '3N PFL'NFN9EN L3N JRNDHNLP'DDGLDP HR3O 1N L9N EN LH2O :R NFL'QNFCO
(GJD9LBA*E)LDM  N N#LINDP'
Artinya: Kami ikut berperang dengan Rosulullah dan istri-istri kami tidak ada di samping kami.
Kemudian kami bertanya kepada Rosulullah  bolehkah kami mengebiri? Maka Rosulullah melarang
kami untuk mengebiri dan memberikan keringanan kepada kami untuk menikahi perempuan
dengan membayar imbalan untuk waktu yang ditentukan. (HR. Bukhari Muslim)
Berdasarkan keterangan di atas  maka jelaslah bahwa kebolehan hukum nikah mutah
pada zaman Nabi itu memiliki alasan sebagai berikut:
a. Merupakan keringanan hukum (rukhsah) untuk memberikan jalan keluar dari
problematika yang dihadapi oleh dua kelompok orang yang imannya kuat dan imannya
lemah.
b. Sebagai langkah perjalanan hukum Islam menuju ditetapkannya kehidupan rumah
tangga yang sempurna untuk mewujudkan semua tujuan pernikahan yaitu melestarikan
keturunan  cinta kasih sayang dan memperluas pergaulan melalui perbesanan.
Terkait dengan hukumnya  dilihat dari prosesnya nampaknya langkah pengharaman
nikah mutah yang ditempuh oleh Islam dilakukan secara periodik seperti proses
pengharaman khamar. Rasulullah SAW memperbolehkan nikah mutah dalam kondisi
tertentu (darurat)  kemudian Rasulullah SAW mengharamkan nikah mutah sebagai bentuk
pernikahan. Sebagaimana Hadits yang diriwayatkan oleh Imam Muslim dalam Shahihnya
dari Syibrah al-Juhani bahwasanya ia berperang bersama Rasulullah saw pada waktu fathu
Makkah  maka Rasulullah mengizinkan mereka untuk melakukan nikah mutah. Ia berkata:
Maka kaum tetap melakukan nikah mutah itu sampai Rasulullah mengharamkan nikah
mutah. Dan dalam redaksi yang lain  terdapat Hadits yang berbunyi

Terdapat perbedaan pendapat di kalangan ulama mengenai siapa yang wajib mengeluarkan zakat hasil tanah yang disewakan  apakah si pemilik tanah atau si penyewa tanah (yang bercocok tanam). Berikut uraian pendapat-pendapat tersebut:

1. Menurut Jumhur Ulama  yang wajib mengeluarkan zakat hasil tanah yang disewakan adalah pihak penyewa. Mereka beralasan karena yang dikeluarkan zakatnya adalah hasil tanahnya bukan tanahnya. Pendapat ini diperkuat oleh Mahmud Syaltut.

2. Menurut Abu Hanifah dan pengikutnya  pemilik tanahlah yang wajib mengeluarkan zakatnya karena dari sebab tanah itulah ada hasil yang diperoleh  tanpa tanah tak akan dapat dihasilkan apa-apa.

3. Menurut Imam Malik  Syafi'i  Imam At-Tsauri  Imam Ibnu Mubarak dan Imam Ibnu Abu Tsaur  penyewa tanahlah yang wajib membayar zakat  pendapat ini sejalan dengan pendapat poin pertama.

Setelah mencermati perbedaan pendapat tersebut  pendapat pertama yang menetapkan bahwa si penyewa yang wajib mengeluarkan zakat memiliki argumentasi yang lebih kuat  karena hal ini diperkuat oleh firman Allah dalam surat al-An'am ayat 141 yang menyatakan bahwa zakat dikeluarkan dari hasil pertanian  bukan dari tanah.

Kata zakat ) L)'CN 2N ) berasal dari bahasa Arab  secara bahasa artinya suci  tumbuh
berkembang dan berkah. Makna zakat secara bahasa ini mencerminkan sifat zakat
yang dapat mensucikan harta dan jiwa serta mengandung nilai positif yang dapat
dikembangkan berupa kebaikan bagi si muzakki dan kemaslahatan ekonomi bagi para
mustahiq. Sebagaimana firman Allah swt:
'GN 'CQN 2N LFR EN L-N NDAR N #L/R NB
Artinya: Sesungguhnya beruntunglah orang-orang yang mensucikan dirinya. (QS.
al-Syams: 9)
Menurut syara  para ulama mendefinisikannya dengan Harta tertentu yang
wajib dikeluarkan sebagiannya kepada para mustahiq. Sedangkan Sayyid Sabiq
mendefinisikan  Zakat adalah suatu nama hak Allah yang harus dikeluarkan oleh manusia
kepada fuqara. Selanjutnya Sabiq menambahkan  Dinamakan zakat karena mengharap
berkah  pensucian diri  dan bertambahnya kebaikan. Hal ini sejalan dengan firman Allah
swt:
'GN (P LER GP JC P 2N O*HN LER GO 1O G P 7N O*LK )NBN/5N LER GP DP'HN ER N #LFR EP L0R .O
Artinya: Ambilah dari harta mereka shadaqah yang dapat membersihkan harta dan
mensucikan jiwa mereka. (QS. At-Taubah: 103).
Dari dua macam pengertian zakat seperti diungkapkan di atas dapat
disimpulkan bahwa zakat adalah kewajiban seseorang untuk mengeluarkan sebagian
harta miliknya yang sudah memenuhi syarat untuk dizakati kepada orang yang
berhak menerimanya (mustahiq).
Zakat sering juga disebut shadaqah ( )B/5) karena tindakan itu adalah
tindakan yang benar (shidq). Istilah zakat dalam al-Qur'an sering sekali
penyebutannya digandengkan dengan kata sholat  ditemukan sebanyak 82 ayat.
Penyelarasan ini menunjukkan bahwa zakat merupakan rukun Islam yang sangat
penting setelah perkara sholat.

A. ZAKAT HASIL TANAH YANG DISEWAKAN
Dalam istilah ekonomi  zakat merupakan suatu tindakan pemindahan harta
kekayaan dari golongan kaya kepada golongan miskin (mustahik). Transfer kekayaan
berarti juga transfer sumber-sumber ekonomi. Rahardjo (1987) menyatakan bahwa
dengan menggunakan pendekatan ekonomi  zakat bisa berkembang menjadi konsep
kemasyarakatan (muamalah)  yaitu konsep tentang bagaimana cara manusia
melakukan kehidupan bermasyarakat termasuk di dalamnya bentuk ekonomi. Oleh
karena itu ada dua konsep yang selalu dikemukakan dalam pembahasan mengenai
sosial ekonomi Islam yang saling berkaitan yaitu pelarangan riba dan perintah
membayar zakat (Q.S al-Baqarah [2]: 276).
Mencermati judul di atas setidaknya terdapat pertanyaan dalam benak
saudara  siapa yang wajib mengeluarkan zakat dari tanah yang disewakan  apakah si
pemilik tanah atau pihak penyewa tanah. Sepintas jawabannya sudah dapat
ditentukan dari judul itu yaitu orang yang menyewa tanah karena dialah orang yang
mendapatkan secara langsung dari hasil tanah tersebut. Namun demikian 
ditemukan pendapat bahwa si pemilik tanahlah yang terkena kewajiban zakatnya
karena tanpa tanah tidak mungkin didapati hasil tanaman. Terdapat juga pendapat
yang mengatakan bahwa hukumnya dikembalikan kepada kesepakatan antara dua
belah pihak sebelum transaksi dilakukan  berikut bahasannya.
1. Pengertian dan Dasar Hukum Zakat Tanah yang Disewakan
Setelah memahami pengertian zakat  maka perlu juga memahami pengertian
sewa-menyewa atau ijarah. Sewa-menyewa adalah memanfaatkan suatu barang baik
barang milik sendiri atau barang orang lain. Istilah ini dikenal dalam Bahasa Arab
disebut dengan istilah ijarah yang berasal dari kata al-ajru yang mengandung arti upah
atau menjual manfaat. Zuhaily yang dikutip oleh Ismail Nawawi dalam bukunya
yang berjudul Fiqh Muamalah Klasik dan Kontemporer mengatakan bahwa
Transaksi sewa (ijarah) identik dengan jual beli  tetapi dalam sewa pemilikan
dibatasi dengan waktu tertentu.
10

Akad ijarah dianggap sah jika memenuhi rukun-rukunya yang meliputi
pertama  Mujir dan mustajir  yaitu pihak-pihak yang melakukan akad sewa. Mujir
yakni orang yang menyewa  mustajir yakni orang yang memberi sewa. Kedua  Sighat 
ijab qabul antara mujir dan mustajir. Ketiga  Ajr atau upah yang dibayarkan dan
keempat  Barang yang disewakan.
Dengan demikian  pengertian zakat tanah yang disewakan adalah zakat yang
dikeluarkan dari tanah yang disewakan. Zakat tanah yang disewakan harus
memenuhi beberapa komponen dalam transaksi zakat hasil tanah yang disewakan
sebagai berikut:
a. Sebidang tanah yang disewakan ( O )1N  N R #N*3R EO DR'L6O 1R ND#LN#)
b. Pemilik tanah ( O 61R ND#N#L (K -P '5N ): Orang yang menyewakan tanahnya kepada
orang lain.
c. Penyewa tanah( O 1 P R #N*3R EO DRN#) sekaligus penggarap tanah yang disewakan.
d. Ajru (upah) yang dibayarkan oleh penyewa kepada pemilik tanah.
Berdasar kepada beberapa ketentuan di atas  dalam penyewaan tanah 
sedikitnya terdapat dua pihak yang terlibat dalam transaksi penyewaan tanah yaitu
pemilik tanah dan penyewa  yang keduanya bersepakat mengadakan transaksi.
Dengan kata lain  zakat hasil tanah yang disewakan ( O )1N  N R #N*3R EO DR'L6P 1R ND'R'LO)'LCN 2N ) dapat
diartikan sebagai zakat hasil tanah yang langsung dihasilkan oleh tanah tersebut
berupa tumbuh-tumbuhan yang menghasilkan buah. Hasil dimaksud bisa berupa
makanan pokok  seperti padi  kurma  gandum atau buah-buahan  seperti  jeruk 
anggur  semangka  atau berupa sayur-sayuran  seperti ketimun  kacang  bawang  dan
lain sebagainya. Kewajiban untuk mengeluarkan zakat hasil tanah yang disewakan
didasari oleh ayat berikut ini:
LFN HO*JR 2QN D'HN LOGODCO O #L'KADPN*.R EO L9N 1R 2QN D'HN LDN .R QNFD'HN L*M '4N H1O 9R EN L1N JR :N HN L*M '4N H1O 9R EN L*M 'QNF N LN #4N FRN #LJ0P QN D'LHN GO HN

Artinya: Dan Dialah yang telah menjadikan kebun-kebun yang berjunjung dan yang
tidak berjunjung  pohon korma  tumbuh-tumbuhan yang beraneka ragam buahnya  zaitun
dan delima yang serupa bentuk dan warnanya dan tidak sama rasanya. Makanlah buah-
buah tersebut jika panen dan keluarkanlah haknya (zakatnya) ketika panen. Dan janganlah
11

kamu berlebih-lebihan. Sesungguhnya Allah tidak suka kepada orang yang berlebih-
lebihan. (QS. al-Anam: 141)
Sedangkan dasar dari Hadits mengenai wajibnya zakat hasil tanah:
L1P 4O O9DR'LAO 5R PFL)P NJPF'3QN D'P(LJ
N
BP 3O L'EN JR PAL1O HR 4O O9DR'LEO JR N:DR'HN 1O 'GN FR ND'R'L*P NB3N L'EN JR PA
(ED3EHL/E-'LG'H1)
Artinya: Tanaman yang tumbuh diari oleh air yang menggunakan alat  zakatnya
sebanyak lima persen. Sedangkan tanaman yang diairi oleh air hujan sebanyak sepuluh
persen.
Jika dicermati  mengapa hasil tanah yang diairi oleh alat lebih kecil dari pada
yang diairi oleh air hujan? Hal ini karena yang memakai alat itu membutuhkan biaya 
sedangkan yang memakai air hujan tidak membutuhkan biaya. Dengan demikian 
terdapat keadilan di dalamnya.
Zakat hasil tanah wajib dikeluarkan zakatnya setiap panen  tidak berlaku
untuknya haul (genap satu tahun) di dalamnya. Jika satu tahun itu dua kali panen 
maka zakatnya pun dua kali. Sedangkan ketentuan nisabnya menurut M. Syaltut  baik
sedikit atau banyak hasil panennya tetap dizakatkan karena menurutnya agar
tumbuh selalu sikap solidaritas sosial sebagai hikmah diwajibkannya zakat.
Menurut Majma al-Faqih al-Islam yang dikutip oleh Wahbah Zuhaili tentang
zakat harta yang tidak bergerak dan tanah yang disewakan terutama tanah yang
disewakan bukan untuk pertanian maka tidak ada kewajiban zakat pada aset harta
tidak bergerak dan tanah yang disewakan karena yang wajib dizakati adalah hasil
pemasukan dari harta yang tidak bergerak dan tanah yang disewakan itu. Jika tanah
yang disewakan itu menghasilkan seperti pertanian atau apapun yang dikelolanya
maka wajib mengeluarkan zakat sebesar 2 5 % setelah berlalunya waktu satu tahun
(haul) dari waktu al-qabdhu (penyerahterimaan) dengan tetap memperhatikan
terpenuhinya syarat-syarat zakat dan tidak ada hal-hal yang menghalanginya.
2. Siapa yang Wajib Mengeluarkan Zakatnya
Ketentuan bahwa zakat hasil tanah yang disewakan wajib dikeluarkan
zakatnya tidak memunculkan masalah jika tanah itu ditanami oleh pemiliknya
langsung. Persoalannya jika tanah itu disewakan kepada orang lain  maka hal ini akan
12

memunculkan masalah  siapa yang wajib mengeluarkan zakat hasil tanah yang
disewakan? Apakah si pemilik tanah atau si penyewa tanah (yang bercocok tanam).
Untuk menjawab kasus hukum ini tidak terdapat kata sepakat di kalangan para ulama
mereka berselisih dalam menetapkan hukumnya seperti diuraikan berikut ini.
Pertama  menurut Jumhur ulama  bahwa yang wajib mengeluarkan zakat hasil
tanah yang disewakan adalah pihak penyewa. Mereka beralasan karena yang
dikeluarkan zakatnya adalah hasil tanahnya bukan tanahnya hal ini diperkuat oleh
pendapat Mahmud Syaltut.

Artinya:Pendapat yang kami pegang bahwasanya kewajiban zakat ada pada pihak
penyewa yang langsung menggarap pertanian. Dan zakat merupakan hak pertanian
sebagai rasa syukur atas nimat berhasilnya pertanian. Dengan demikian penyewalah
yang dibebani untuk mengeluarkan zakat hasil tanah yang disewakan.
Kedua  menurut pendapat Abu Hanifah dan pengikutnya bahwa pemilik
tanahlah yang wajib mengeluarkan zakatnya karena dari sebab tanah itulah ada hasil
yang diperoleh.  tanpa tanah tak akan dapat dihasilkan apa-apa.
Ketiga  Imam Malik  Syafii  Imam At-Tsauri  Imam Ibnu Mubarak dan Imam
Ibnu Abu Tsaur berpendapat  penyewa tanahlah yang wajib membayar zakat 
pendapat ini sejalan dengan pendapat poin pertama.
Mencermati perselisihan pendapat tentang zakat hasil tanah yang disewakan
sebagaimana tersebut di atas dapat dikelompokkan perbedaannya menjadi dua
kelompok dengan alasannya masing-masing.
Pendapat pertama adalah ulama yang menetapkan bahwa si penyewa dalam
hal ini orang yang menggarap tanah yang wajib mengeluarkan zakat karena dialah
yang secara langsung memperoleh hasil dari tanah tersebut. Sedangkan pendapat
kedua menetapkan bahwa si pemilik tanahlah yang wajib mengeluarkan zakatnya
karena si pemilik tanah tersebut mendapatkan uang sewa. Jika diperbandingkan
alasan dari kedua kelompok tersebut  maka pendapat pertama memiliki argumentasi
yang lebih kuat karena hal ini diperkuat oleh firman Allah swt dalam surat al-Anam
13

ayat 141 seperti tersebut di atas yang menyebutkan bahwa hasil tanah yang wajib
dikeluarkan zakatnya bukan tanahnya. Diperkuat pula oleh Hadits Rasulullah
sebagaimana tersebut di atas. Berdasarkan kepada dalil-dali tersebut  fuqaha telah
sepakat bahwa yang dizakatkan adalah hasil tanah bukan tanahnya; maka sebidang
tanah yang tidak ditanami tidak wajib dikeluarkan zakatnya. Dengan demikian  tanah
yang disewakan jika dilihat dari hasilnya itu adalah milik sempurna pihak si
penyewa. Maka tidaklah tepat alasan yang diajukan oleh kelompok kedua yang
berpendapat bahwa pemilik tanahlah yang wajib mengeluarkan zakatnya.
Terkait dengan status tanah yang disewakan itu tetap milik orang yang
menyewakan dan di sisi lain terdapat kewajiban untuk mengeluarkan kewajiban
pajak. Jika berpegang kepada pendapat pertama seperti dijelaskan di atas maka
sebenarnya dengan status tersebut terjadi pembagian kewajiban yang cukup merata
karena kedua belah pihak memiliki andil  yakni si penyewa wajib membayar zakat
dan di sisi lain si pemilik tanah membayar pajak tanah  maka pendapat pertama ini
dipandang lebih adil dan tidak memberatkan kedua-belah pihak.
Solusi lain yang juga dapat dipandang bijak dalam pemerataan pengeluaran
zakat adalah pendapat yang ditawarkan oleh Abu Zahra. Menurutnya  kedua-duanya
baik si pemilik tanah maupun si penyewa sama-sama wajib mengeluarkan zakat. Hal
ini demi memenuhi keadilan dalam pemungutan zakat  dengan ketentuan pihak
penyewa mengeluarkan zakat tanaman setelah dikurangi harga sewa yang ia bayar
kepada pemilik tanah; sedangkan pemilik tanah mengeluarkan zakat atas dasar harga
sewa yang ia terima dari si penyewa; yang berarti ia mengeluarkan zakat uang.
Dengan demikian keduanya terkena beban untuk mengeluarkan zakat.
Solusi lain yang dapat dipertimbangkan adalah jika kedua belah pihak sebelum
transaksi telah bersepakat untuk mengeluarkan zakatnya patungan dengan tujuan
agar keduanya tidak terlalu terbebani  maka zakat itu dapat dilakukan secara
patungan antara kedua belah pihak berdasarkan kesepakatan itu.
Adapun ketentuan zakat tanah yang disewakan untuk kegiatan usaha tersebut
diqiyaskan pada zakat perdagangan. Besaran nishabnya setara nishab emas dan perak
senilai 85 gram emas murni  zakatnya sebesar 2 5 %. Cara menghitung zakat
14

perdagangan yakni jumlah total harta dikurangi total biaya yang telah dikeluarkan 
kemudian dikalikan dengan 2 5 %.
Ketentuan di atas mensyaratkan syarat-syarat sebagai berikut: pertama  ada
niat yang diikuti usaha berdagang atau mengelola tanah. Kedua  mencapai waktu
satu tahun (haul) dihitung dari waktu usaha berdagang. Ketiga  mencapai nishab.
Keempat  harta dagang telah menjadi hak milik sempurna  telah dibeli secara tunai.
Kelima  tidak terkait hutang dengan pihak lain.
B. ZAKAT HASIL JASA (PROFESI)
Terhadap hukum zakat profesi  terdapat perbedaan pendapat diantara ulama.
Hal ini antara lain dikarenakan dasar hukum tentang zakat yang dikeluarkan dari
hasil usaha tersebut masih bersifat zhan (dugaan)  berikut bahasannya.
1. Pengertian dan Hukumnya
Dalam terminologi Arab  zakat penghasilan dan profesi lebih populer disebut
dengan istilah zakatu kasb al-amal wa al-mihan al- hurrah ( )1-D'LFGED'HLDE9D'L(3CL)'C2)  atau
zakat atas penghasilan kerja dan profesi bebas. Istilah itu digunakan oleh Yusuf Al-
Qardhawi dalam kitab Fiqhu Zakah dan Wahbah Az-Zuhaili dalam kitab Al Fiqhul
Islami wa Adillatuhu.
Kata profesi menurut kamus besar Bahasa Indonesia mengandung arti
sebidang pekerjaan yang dilandasi oleh pendidikan keahlian berupa keterampilan
dan kejuruan tertentu. Profesi secara istilah berarti suatu pekerjaan yang
membutuhkan pengetahuan  keahlian  dan kepintaran. Yusuf al-Qardhawi lebih jelas
mengemukakan bahwa profesi adalah pekerjaan atau usaha yang menghasilkan uang
atau kekayaan baik pekerjaan atau usaha itu dilakukan sendiri  tanpa bergantung
kepada orang lain  maupun dengan bergantung kepada orang lain  seperti
pemerintah  perusahaan swasta  maupun dengan perorangan dengan memperoleh
upah  gaji  atau honorarium.
Berdasar pengertian profesi di atas  maka zakat profesi dapat dimaknai sebagai
zakat pekerjaan yang sudah menjadi keahlian seseorang yang diperoleh melalui
proses pendidikan seperti dokter  dosen  pengacara  pilot  dan guru  semua contoh
15

pekerjaan ini dapat dikatakan profesi karena keahliannya diperoleh melalui proses
pendidikan yang cukup lama.
Gagasan zakat profesi dipelopori oleh Yusuf Qardhawi dalam kitabnya Fiqh Az
Zakah  yang cetakan pertamanya terbit tahun 1969. Namun tampaknya Yusuf
Qardhawi dalam hal ini mendapat pengaruh dari dua ulama lainnya  yaitu Abdul
Wahhab Khallaf dan Abu Zahrah. Dalil ayat al-Quran yang dijadikan dasar bagi
kewajiban zakat profesi yaitu QS. al-Baqarah. 267. Pekerjaan yang termasuk profesi
bersifat umum  tidak terbatas oleh keahlian yang diperoleh dari pendidikan; namun
juga mencakup semua jenis pekerjaan yang baik. Hal ini dipahami dari ayat :
LER O*(R 3N CN L'EN L*P 'N( JP 7N LFR EP L'HOBAP FRN #L'HOFEN '!N LFN J0P QN D'L'GN QOJN #'NJ
Artinya: Nafkahkanlah dari hasil usahamu yang baik. (QS. al-Baqarah: 267)
Dilihat dari ketergantungannya  profesi bisa dikelompokkan menjadi dua
bagian. Pertama  pekerja ahli yang berdiri sendiri  tidak terikat oleh pemerintah 
seperti dokter swasta  insinyur  pengacara  penjahit  tukang batu  guru  dosen 
wartawan dan konsultan. Kedua  profesi yang terkait dengan pemerintah atau
yayasan atau badan usaha yang menerima gaji setiap bulan. Menurut sebagian ulama 
seperti Ibnu Abbas  Ibnu Masud  dan Muawiyah  kedua kelompok profesi di atas 
baik yang wiraswasta atau pegawai yang terikat oleh suatu instansi  mereka dapat
terkena kewajiban mengeluarkan zakat profesinya ketika menerima upah/gaji
sebesar seperempat puluhnya. Jika rutinitas itu dilakukan maka tidak ada lagi
baginya kewajiban untuk mengeluarkan zakat pada akhir tahun.
Dilihat dari aspek penerimaannya  macam-macam profesi seperti tersebut di
atas dapat dikategorikan menjadi dua. Pertama  hasil usaha yang teratur dan pasti
setiap bulannya  yang termasuk ke dalam kelompok pertama ini seperti upah pekerja
dan gaji pegawai. Kedua  hasil yang tidak tetap dan tidak dapat dipastikan seperti
kontraktor  pengacara  royalti pengarang  konsultan  dan artis.
Dengan demikian  zakat profesi meliputi semua pekerjaan yang halal dan baik.
Zakat dapat dikeluarkan sesuai dengan waktu perolehannya setelah diambil terlebih
dahulu untuk kewajiban biaya terhadap keluarga dan biaya operasional. Seseorang
dengan profesinya yang berpenghasilan pas-pasan bahkan kurang untuk memenuhi
16

kebutuhan hidupnya bukanlah termasuk profesi yang wajib dikeluarkan zakatnya 
bahkan mereka tergolong orang yang berhak menerima zakat (mustahiq); seperti
tukang becak.
Dengan demikian  zakat profesi merupakan zakat wajib yang harus
dikeluarkan umat islam  apabila sudah memenuhi syarat untuk menjadi muzakki.
Indikator pengeluaran zakat profesi merupakan penghasilan yang diperoleh.
Semakin besar penghasilan  maka semakin besar juga zakat yang harus dikeluarkan.
Karena itu  ulama menetapkan nishab zakat prof disetarakan dengan zakat emas 
yakni minimal memiliki harta yang setara dengan harga 85% gram emas. Adapun
syarat-syarat lain yang harus dipenuhi adalah 1) harta kepemilikan penuh  yakni
harta profesi benar-benar milik sendiri; 2) penghasilan sudah memenuhi kebutuhan
pokok; dan 3)telah mencapai nishab; berdasarkan fatwa MUI minimal setara dengan
85 gram emas; sedangkan pendapat Abu Zahra  minimal setara dengan 930 liter atau
653 kg hasil panen. Sedangkan jumhur ulama yang dikutip oleh Sulaiman Rasyid
menetapkan nishabnya adalah setara dengan 93  6 gram Emas. Sedang syarat 4)  
bebas dari hutang; yakni muzakki benar-benar bebas dari hutang.
Fatwa Majelis Ulama Indonesia (MUI) menjelaskan bahwa penghasilan yang
dimaksud ialah setiap pendapatan seperti gaji  honorarium  upah  jasa  dan lain-
lainnya yang diperoleh dengan cara halal  baik rutin seperti pejabat negara  pegawai 
karyawan  maupun tidak rutin seperti dokter  pengacara  konsultan  dan sejenisnya 
serta pendapatan yang diperoleh dari pekerjaan bebas lainnya.
2. Cara Mengeluarkan dan Nisabnya
Berikut ini akan dijelaskan secara singkat cara mengeluarkan zakat profesi
seperti dokter  pengacara  pilot  dosen  artis dan sebagainya. Semua pekerja ini dapat
mengeluarkan zakat profesinya dengan cara tajil  yaitu mempercepat ketika mereka
menerima honor atau gaji. Berapa nisab (batas minimal) dan prosentase yang harus
dikeluarkan? Terjadi perbedaan pendapat para ulama terhadap penetapan nisabnya:
a. Abdurrahman Hasan  Imam Abu Zahra  dan Abdul Wahab Khallaf  mereka
berpendapat bahwa nisab zakat profesi sekurang-kurangnya setara dengan lima
17

wasaq atau 300 sha sekitar 930 liter atau 653 Kg hasil panen. Persentase zakat
disamakan (diqiyaskan) dengan zakat pertanian yang pengairannya
menggunakan alat (mesin)  yaitu sebesar 5 % setiap mendapatkan gaji atau honor.
b. Jumhur ulama berijtihad bahwa nisab zakat profesi adalah harta setara dengan
seharga emas 93 6 gram emas murni yang diambil dari penghasilan bersih setelah
dikeluarkan seluruh biaya hidup. Kelebihan inilah yang dihitung selama satu
tahun  lalu dikeluarkan zakatnya sebanyak 2 5 % setiap bulan. Prosentase ini
diqiyaskan dengan zakat mata uang yang telah ditetapkan oleh Hadits.
c. Terdapat juga pendapat yang mengatakan bahwa zakat profesi disamakan
dengan zakat rikaz (barang temuan) maka tidak ada syarat nisab dan
prosentasenya 20 persen pada saat menerimanya.
d. Majelis Ulama Indonesia (MUI) dalam fatwa MUI No 3 tanggal 7 Juni tahun 2003
menyebutkan bahwa semua bentuk penghasilan halal wajib dikeluarkan
zakatnya dengan syarat telah mencapai nishab dalam satu tahun  yakni senilai
emas 85 gram dalam setahun. Zakat penghasilan dapat dikeluarkan pada saat
menerima jika sudah cukup nishab. Jika tidak mencapai nishab  maka semua
penghasilan dikumpulkan selama satu tahun; kemudian zakat dikeluarkan jika
penghasilan bersihnya sudah cukup nishab.
C. Contoh Kasus
Ali adalah seorang pendidik golongan IV/a dengan masa kerja selama 20
tahun. Ia memiliki seorang istri dan tiga anak. Penghasilannya tiap bulan pada
tahun 2015 sebagai berikut:
a. Gaji dari Negara Rp. 4.300.000
c. Honor dari beberapa PTS Rp. 2.500.000
d. Honor dari yang lain Rp. 2.000.000
Pengeluaran setiap bulan:
a. Keperluan keluarga Rp. 3.000.000
b. Angsuran kredit rumah Rp. 1.250.000
18

c. Dan lain-lain Rp. 1.500.000
Kalkulasi
Penerimaan Rp. 8.800.000
Pengeluaran Rp. 5.750.000
Sisa Rp. 3.050.000
Jika sisa di atas dikalikan setahun  maka berjumlah Rp. 36.600.000. Jumlah
tersebut tidak memenuhi nisab emas  yakni 85 gram emas yang pada tahun 2015
seharga Rp 525.000 per gram  atau sekitar Rp .44.625.00. Dengan demikian  maka Pak
Ali belum diwajibkan mengeluarkan zakat.
Contoh lainnya adalah sebagai berikut:
Andi adalah seorang eksekutif muda di sebuah perusahaan IT.
Penghasilannya tiap bulan pada tahun 2021 sebagai berikut 
a. Gaji Pokok Rp. 15.000.000
b. Bonus dan Insentif Rp. 12.500.000
c. Honor dari yang lain Rp. 7.500.000
Pengeluaran setiap bulan:
a. Keperluan keluarga Rp. 5.000.000
b. Dan lain-lain Rp. 10.000.000
Kalkulasi
Penerimaan Rp. 25.000.000
Pengeluaran Rp. 15.000.000
Sisa Rp. 10.000.000
Jika sisa di atas dikalikan setahun  maka berjumlah Rp. 120.000.000. Jumlah
tersebut telah memenuhi nisab emas  yakni 85 gram emas yang pada tahun 2021
seharga Rp 79.738.415 -. Dengan demikian  maka Pak Andi diwajibkan mengeluarkan
zakat dengan perhitungan 2 5 % x Rp. 120.000.000 = Rp. 3.000. 000. Bila Pak Andi
mengeluarkannya secara tajil atau didahulukan  maka Pak Andi dapat
mengeluarkannya secara bulanan  hingga beliau hanya membayar Rp. 250.000 setiap
bulannya.
19

Uraian di atas merupakan konsep zakat profesi bagi yang mendukung adanya
zakat profesi. Namun dengan demikian  terdapat juga ulama yang mengatakan
bahwa zakat profesi itu tidak ada dengan alasan karena sulit menentukan jenis profesi
dan nisabnya. Mereka yang menolak zakat profesi tersebut karena mereka
memasukkan zakat profesi kepada zakat harta yang harus dibayar jika sudah
sempurna satu tahun (haul); dan mempertahankan harta dengan nilai nisab selama
satu tahun dari berbagai kebutuhan bukanlah sesuatu hal yang mudah.
Perlu dipahami bahwa mengeluarkan zakat adalah manifestasi dari keislaman
seseorang sebagai rasa syukur kepada Allah swt atas nikmat yang telah diterimanya.
Di antara nikmat tersebut adalah karena memiliki profesi. Maka ijtihad yang
menetapkan adanya zakat profesi yang belum pernah ada pada zaman klasik Islam
perlu direspons secara positif. Hukum Islam selalu relevan dengan perkembangan
zaman. Zakat profesi adalah hasil ijtihad yang sejalan dengan prinsip hukum Islam
yang memberikan pintu kemudahan  dalam hal ini penunaian zakat secara tajil
(disegerakan) sehingga dapat menghilangkan kealpaan seseorang dalam penunaian
zakat.
Seseorang dikatakan sudah wajib menunaikan zakat penghasilan apabila
mampu menyisihkan bagian dari penghasilannya dan mencapai nishab zakat
pendapatan yang minimal setara dengan harga 85 gram emas per tahun. Hal ini juga
dikuatkan dalam SK BAZNAS Tahun 2021 Tentang Nisab Zakat Pendapatan dan Jasa
tahun 2021  bahwa;
Nishab zakat pendapatan/ penghasilan pada tahun 2021 adalah senilai 85
gram emas atau setara dengan Rp79.738.415 - (Tujuh puluh sembilan juta tujuh
ratus tiga puluh delapan empat ratus lima belas rupiah) per tahun atau
Rp6.644.868 - (Enam juta enam ratus empat puluh empat ribu delapan ratus
enam puluh delapan rupiah) per bulan.
Dalam praktiknya  zakat penghasilan dapat ditunaikan setiap bulan dengan
nilai nishab penghasilan setiap bulan minimal 6.644.868. Mereka yang telah mampu
menyisihkan dari harta penghasilan dengan jumlah tersebut wajib mengeluarkan
zakatnya 2 5%. Sebagian berpendapat  bahwa nisab tersebut bukanlah diambil dari
sisa penghasilan setelah dikurangi dari kebutuhan pokok; namun dari jumlah
20

penghasilan secara keseluruhan tanpa harus dipotong untuk kebutuhan pokoknya;
sebab kebutuhan pokok terkadang sering dibuat-buat untuk menghindari kewajiban
mengeluarkan zakat profesinya.
C. ZAKAT PRODUKTIF
Kemunculan istilah di atas dapat dikatakan sebagai sebuah bentuk kritik
terhadap penyaluran zakat kepada mustahiq yang pada umumnya bersifat konsumtif.
Zakat yang diterima oleh mustahiq biasanya bersifat konvensional yaitu sekedar
untuk memenuhi kebutuhan hidup sehari-hari yang sifatnya menghabiskan.
Namun di sisi lain terdapat mustahiq yang keberadaannya masih produktif baik dari
tenaga  ilmu dan keterampilan. Mustahiq yang masih mampu produktif tersebut dapat
diberikan zakat berupa modal usaha untuk pengembangan kemampuan yang
dimilikinya. Permasalahannya yang kemudian muncul bagaimana hukum
penyaluran zakat untuk modal usaha? berikut bahasannya.
1. Gagasan Zakat Produktif
Zakat merupakan ibadah maal (materi) yang memiliki fungsi strategis untuk
membangun perekonomian umat Islam. Kedudukannya sebagai salah satu rukun
Islam mengharuskan umat Islam untuk mengimani dan melaksanakannya. Orang
yang menganggap zakat bukan rukun Islam  maka ia dapat dianggap kafir dan orang
yang tidak berzakat padahal telah diwajibkan maka ia telah melakukan perbuatan
dosa karena telah menolak perintah Allah dan telah mengabaikan hak para mustahiq.
Oleh karena itu  penunaian zakat bukan sekedar untuk menggugurkan kewajiban tapi
berdampak positif kepada kehidupan sosial karena keberadaannya dapat
mensejahterakan kehidupan bagi orang yang tidak mampu.
Ide untuk mengembangkan zakat sebagai modal usaha muncul ketika fokus
perhatian dilakukan secara seksama bahwa para fuqara dan masakin tidak semuanya
orang-orang yang memiliki keterbatasan kekuatan fisik. Di antara mereka terdapat
banyak yang memiliki kesehatan fisik dan keahlian yang dapat dikembangkan  tapi
mereka tidak memiliki modal. Sehingga keluar ide untuk memberikan zakat kepada
mereka untuk bisa dijadikan sebagai modal usaha yang dapat meningkatkan status
21

ekonominya dan sekaligus mengembangkan keahlian yang mereka miliki. Maka
pihak yang paling berperan dalam zakat produktif ini adalah kreatifitas mustahiq
untuk menjadikan zakat sebagai modal yang terus dikembangkan.
2. Prospek Zakat Produktif
Prospek ke depan  zakat yang diperoleh dari hasil usaha ini memiliki peluang
yang cerah jika pengelolaannya dilakukan secara baik dan profesional. Pengelolaan
itu dapat dilakukan melalui pengembangan sumber daya mustahiq yang potensial
yang jumlahnya cukup banyak. Lain halnya ketika menghadapi mustahiq zakat yang
konsumtif  yaitu yang tidak memiliki kemampuan dan keahlian untuk
mengembangkan zakat seperti orang jompo  anak yatim yang masih kecil  orang
dewasa yang cacat atau sakit berat maka zakat untuk mereka ini hanya untuk
membantu kelangsungan hidup mereka karena mereka lebih banyak bersifat pasif.
Bagi mustahiq zakat yang produktif atau disebut mustahiq aktif  mereka masih
berumur produktif dan memiliki badan yang sehat  maka selayaknya bagi mereka
zakat dapat disalurkan secara produktif yaitu dengan menjadikan zakat sebagai
modal usaha. Oleh karena itu diperlukan sikap proaktif dari mustahiq untuk
mencurahkan kemampuannya dalam pengembangan modal dari zakat itu.
Menurut hemat penulis  usaha pengembangan zakat menjadi modal usaha
memerlukan sumber daya manusia (SDM) yang cukup handal. Oleh karena itu
diperlukan upaya untuk meningkatkan SDM (sumber daya manusia) mustahiq
dengan mengadakan pelatihan atau training yang dapat dilakukan oleh badan 
seperti bazis atau pemerintah  sehingga mereka benar-benar memiliki keahlian yang
mapan untuk dapat mengembangkan modal usaha yang didapat dari zakat tersebut.
Selain itu di masyarakat terdapat banyak keahlian yang dimiliki oleh mereka yang
tergolong mustahiq yang tampaknya diperoleh tanpa melalui latihan khusus seperti
pedagang kaki lima  sopir  pengrajin tangan  tukang kuli batu  dan lain sebagainya.
Jika penyaluran zakat dilakukan dengan baik serta penggunaannya terbilang optimal 
maka hal ini akan dapat meningkatkan taraf ekonomi mereka yang tergolong lemah
untuk selanjutnya diharapkan kehidupan mereka tidak bergantung kepada zakat.
22

Untuk mereka  zakat hanya modal pertama saja selanjutnya mereka tidak lagi sebagai
mustahiq zakat  tapi menjadi orang yang wajib mengeluarkan zakat (muzakki).
Uraian di atas memperlihatkan bahwa sesungguhnya keberadaan zakat
produktif itu dapat dibenarkan. Pemberian modal kepada mustahiq zakat sebagai
modal usaha berarti memberikan perhatian kepada para mustahiq untuk hidup lebih
layak  hal ini merupakan ajaran Islam seperti diperkuat oleh al-Quran:
L!N 'NJPF:R N #LDO GP 'NN DR 'LLEO GO O(L3N -R JN L6P 1R N D#R 'LJPAL'K(1R 6N LFN HO9J7P N*3R NJLD'N LP'DDQNQN LDP JP(3N LJPAL'H1O 5P -R O #LFN J0P QN D'L!P '1N NBOADR DP
LE JDP9N LGP LP(LN'DDQNQN LFQN P%NAL1M JR .N LFR EP L'HOBAP FRO*L'EN HN L'KA'-N DR P%L3N 'QNFD'LFN HODN #3R NJLD'N LER GO 'EN J3P P(LER GO OA1P 9R N*LAP QOAN9QN*D'LFN EP
Artinya: Berinfaklah untuk orang-orang faqir yang terikat oleh jihad di jalan Allah 
mereka tidak mampu berusaha di bumi. Orang yang tidak tahu  menyangka mereka adalah
orang yang kaya karena memelihara diri dari meminta-minta. Kamu melihat mereka
dengan melihat sifat-sifatnya. Mereka tidak meminta-minta kepada orang secara
mendesak. Dan apa yang kamu nafkahkan di jalan Allah  sesungguhnya Allah Maha
Mengetahui. (QS. al-Baqarah: 273)
Arif Mufraini dalam Buku Akuntansi dan Manajemen Zakat (2006:147) telah
mengemas bentuk inovasi pendistribusian zakat yang dikategorikan dalam empat
bentuk: Pertama  distribusi bersifat konsumtif tradisional  yaitu zakat dibagikan
kepada mustahik untuk dimanfaatkan secara langsung  seperti zakat fitrah  atau zakat
mal yang dibagikan kepada para korban bencana alam. Kedua  distribusi bersifat
konsumtif kreatif. yaitu zakat yang diwujudkan dalam bentuk lain dari barangnya
semula  seperti diberikan dalam bentuk alat-alat sekolah atau beasiswa. Ketiga 
distribusi bersifat produktif tradisional  yaitu zakat diberikan dalam bentuk
barang-barang yang produktif seperti kambing  sapi  dan lain sebagainya. Pemberian
dalam bentuk ini dapat menciptakan usaha yang membuka lapangan kerja bagi fakir
miskin. Keempat  distribusi dalam bentuk produktif kreatif  yaitu zakat
diwujudkan dalam bentuk permodalan baik untuk menambah modal pedagang
pengusaha kecil ataupun membangun proyek sosial dan proyek ekonomis.
Dengan demikian  zakat produktif adalah zakat yang didistribusikan kepada
mustahik  yang dikelola dan dikembangkan melalui perilaku-perilaku bisnis.
Indikasinya adalah harta zakat dimanfaatkan sebagai modal yang diharapkan dapat
meningkatkan taraf ekonomi mustahik. Termasuk juga dalam pengertian zakat
23

produktif jika harta zakat dikelola dan dikembangkan oleh amil yang hasilnya
disalurkan kepada mustahik secara berkala. Lebih tegasnya zakat produktif adalah
zakat yang disalurkan kepada mustahik dengan cara yang tepat guna  efektif
manfaatnya dengan sistem yang serba guna dan produktif  sesuai dengan pesan
syariat dan peran serta fungsi sosial ekonomis dari zakat.
Hikmah yang dapat dipetik dari praktek zakat produktif diantaranya agar
terjadi komunikasi yang dapat menghilangkan menara gading antara si miskin
dengan si kaya. Efek yang ditimbulkannya menjadikan si muzakki (pemberi zakat)
akan merasa puas dan senang karena zakatnya bisa berkembang; di sisi lain
menjadikan mustahiq tidak menjadi mental pengemis dan tersalurkan
kemampuannya. Dengan demikian terjadi hubungan yang signifikan antara
keberadaan zakat produktif dengan peningkatan sumber daya manusia. Dan yang
terpenting lagi  dengan zakat produktif tidak terjadi sikap pembiaran terhadap fakir
miskin dan menjadikannya cara untuk menyelamatkan mustahik dari bahaya
kefakiran yang dapat menjadikan seorang menjadi kafir  sebagaimana diperkuat oleh
Hadits Nabi:
'1K AR CO LFN HR CO NJLFR N #L1O BR NADR'LN/'CN
Artinya: Kefakiran (kemiskinan) berakibat kepada kekafiran.
Dengan demikian  zakat produktif ini memiliki hikmah syari yang serupa
dengan hikmah zakat yaitu mensejahterakan kehidupan mustahik. Dengan zakat
produktif  status mustahik mampu berubah menjadi muzakki dengan potensi yang
dimilikinya; mustahik akan mampu memberdayakan dana zakat yang diterimanya
sebagai modal usaha yang pada akhirnya  ia pun akan menjadi pengusaha yang
sukses.
D. PENYALURAN ZAKAT UNTUK PEMBANGUNAN MASJID
Penjelasan tentang kelompok orang yang berhak menerima sudah cukup jelas
diinformasikan oleh al-Quran. Secara tekstual istilah masjid tidak terdapat dalam
kelompok yang delapan tersebut. inilah yang menimbulkan permasalahan apakah
zakat dapat disalurkan untuk pembangunan dan pemugaran masjid. Uraian berikut
24

mencoba untuk menjelaskan hukum penyaluran kepada sesuatu yang diluar asnaf
(kelompok mustahiq zakat tersebut).
1. Kelompok Mustahiq Zakat
Jumhur ulama sepakat bahwa kelompok mustahiq zakat itu terdiri delapan
asnaf atau bagian. Kesepakatan tersebut didasari oleh ayat al-Quran surat al-Taubat
ayat 60 sebagai berikut:
LFN JEP 1P 'N:DR 'LHN L(P 'NBL1 P D'LJPAHN LER GO O(HODOBL)P NAQN D$N EO DR 'HN L'GN JR DN 9N LFN JDPEP 'N9DR 'HN LFP JCP '3N EN DR 'HN L!P '1N NBOADR DPL*O 'NBN/5QN D'L'EN QNFP%
LE JCP -N LE JDP9N LO'DDQNQN HN LP'DDQNQN LFN EP LK )6N J1P NALDP JP(3QN D'LFP (R P'HN LP'DDQNQN LDP J(P 3N LJPAHN
Artinya: Shadaqah adalah hak untuk fakir  miskin  amil zakat  muallaf  budak  orang yang
terlilit hutang  di jalan Allah  dan orang yang dalam perjalanan (musafir). Sebagai
kewajiban yang datang dari Allah dan Allah Maha Mengetahui dan Maha Bijaksana.
(QS. at-Taubah: 60)
Delapan kelompok (mustahiq) zakat sebagaimana tercantum dalam ayat di atas 
penjelasannya sebagai berikut. Fuqara  yaitu Orang yang tidak memiliki harta dan
pekerjaan yang dapat memenuhi kebutuhannya sehari-hari. Orang yang termasuk
kelompok ini tidak memiliki suami (isteri)  ayah  ibu  dan anak yang dapat memenuhi
kebutuhan hidupnya. Masakin  yaitu Orang yang memiliki pekerjaan  tapi hasilnya
tidak dapat memenuhi kebutuhannya  Amilin yaitu Yaitu orang yang bekerja
memungut zakat (panitia zakat). Muallaf  pengertiannya dapat berarti orang yang
baru masuk Islam sedangkan imannya masih lemah  maka untuk menguatkannya
perlu diyakinkan dengan zakat. Atau orang kafir yang berniat untuk masuk Islam 
tapi masih tipis keimanannya  maka ia dapat diberi zakat supaya niat masuk Islamnya
menjadi kuat. Budak  yaitu orang yang hidupnya tidak merdeka  dikuasai oleh
tuannya dan berniat untuk membebaskan dirinya Orang yang terlilit hutang  yaitu
orang yang memiliki tunggakan hutang kepada orang lain baik hutang tersebut
untuk kepentingan pribadinya atau hutang karena untuk biaya kebajikan. Orang
yang berjuang di jalan Allah  yaitu para tentara yang berperang melawan serangan
orang kafir. Orang yang sedang dalam perjalanan. Yaitu orang yang sedang
melakukan sebuah perjalanan dengan tujuan yang baik bukan untuk kemaksiatan 
seperti pelajar atau mahasiswa yang belajar di luar negeri.

2. Hukum Zakat untuk Pembangunan Masjid
Seperti terungkap di muka  permasalahan yang muncul adalah  apa hukum
zakat untuk pembangunan masjid? Sebab dalam surat at-Taubah ayat 60 
sebagaimana dijelaskan di atas  pembangunan dan pemugaran mesjid tidak termasuk
ke dalam mustahiq zakat. Oleh karena itu  untuk menjawab pertanyaan di atas
diperlukan ijtihad yang dapat menentukan pintu masuk kepada kelompok mana
zakat untuk pembangunan masjid itu?
Di antara kedelapan macam mustahiq zakat seperti tersebut di atas  terdapat
mustahiq yang disebut sabilillah yang secara bahasa artinya jalan Allah. Para ulama
dalam memahami kata sabilillah tidak hanya terbatas pada makna hakiki yaitu para
pejuang yang berperang menegakkan agama Allah tapi memahaminya juga dari
makna majazi yang bersifat umum. Terkait dengan makna yang terakhir ini  para
ulama memiliki penafsiran yang beraneka ragam.
Menurut Mahmud Syaltut  istilah sabilillah memiliki arti kemaslahatan umat
yang manfaatnya kembali kepada kaum muslimin seperti pembangunan mesjid 
rumah sakit  perlengkapan pendidikan  dan sebagainya. Memperkuat pendapatnya 
Syaltut mengutip pendapat Imam Al-Razi yang mengatakan bahwa kata sabilillah
tidak terbatas pada arti tentara. Syaltut juga mengutip pendapat al-Qaffal yang
berpendapat bahwa boleh menyalurkan zakat ke semua bentuk kebaikan seperti
untuk mengurus mayat  membangun benteng  dan pembangunan masjid. Tetapi
Syaltut memberikan catatan bahwa zakat yang diperbolehkan untuk pembangunan
masjid dengan syarat masjid itu hanya satu-satunya di suatu desa  atau untuk
pembangunan masjid baru karena mesjid yang tersedia tidak cukup lagi untuk
menampung jamaah. Menurut Syaltut  arti sabilillah dapat disimpulkan menyangkut
pemeliharaan posisi materi dan spiritual suatu bangsa termasuk di dalamnya masjid.
Menurut al-Maraghi  istilah sabilillah adalah semua perkara yang berhubungan
dengan kemaslahatan ummat dapat dimasukkan ke dalam sabilillah  seperti perkara
yang menyangkut masalah agama dan pemerintahan  seperti masalah pelayanan haji.
26

M. Rasyid Ridha berpendapat bahwa  istilah sabilillah mencakup semua
kepentingan syariah secara umum yang berkenaan dengan masalah agama dan
negara dan yang terpenting  untuk persiapan kepentingan perang dengan membeli
persenjataan.
Menurut Yusuf Qardhawi  istilah sabilillah memiliki arti yang lentur  yaitu
semua sarana yang dapat dipergunakan untuk memperjuangkan kemajuan ummat
Islam dan melawan semua bentuk serangan orang-orang kafir  semuanya termasuk
sabilillah. Lebih rinci  beliau menyebutkan usaha pembebasan Islam dari kekuasaan
dengan memerangi kaum kafir  sarana pendidikan dan pengajaran serta lembaga
dakwah  surat kabar islami  penerbitan buku-buku islami dan para dai  semua yang
disebutkan di atas dapat dimasukkan ke dalam cakupan makna sabilillah.
Sayyid Sabiq berpendapat  bahwa istilah sabilillah adalah semua jalan yang
dapat menyampaikan kepada keridhaan Allah  baik berupa ilmu atau amal.
Mencermati pendapat-pendapat di atas  maka dapatlah disimpulkan bahwa
pengertian sabilillah secara umum dapat mencakup semua jalan kebaikan yang
manfaatnya kembali kepada umat Islam termasuk di dalamya adalah masjid 
penyebutan sarana ibadah yang disebutkan terakhir ini secara jelas disebut oleh
Mahmud Syaltut pada point pertama. Pengertian mazaj semacam ini dalam hukum
Islam dapat ditolerir selama tidak bertentangan dengan kaidah agama. Keberadaan
masjid dalam masyarakat memiliki peranan strategis  fungsinya bukan hanya sebagai
tempat sholat  tapi dapat dijadikan pusat pendidikan  dakwah  serta sosial
kemasyarakatan dalam rangka menegakkan agama Allah swt. Dengan demikian 
zakat boleh disalurkan untuk pembangunan masjid karena mesjid termasuk sabilillah
yang mengandung manfaat bagi umat Islam.
Selanjutnya menurut penulis  skala prioritas harus diutamakan. Terlebih
sekarang ini  keberadaan masjid di masyarakat begitu banyak dan pesat  sehingga
jarak masjid sangat berdekatan dan relatif jamaahnya di beberapa masjid ditemukan
sangat sedikit. Mengingat hal itu  penulis sejalan dengan Mahmud Syaltut yang
berpendapat bahwa penyaluran zakat untuk masjid itu harus diutamakan untuk
masjid baru yang dibangun karena masjid yang berdekatan sudah tidak mampu lagi
27

untuk menampung jamaah atau untuk agenda perluasan masjid karena daya
tampungnya tidak lagi mencukupi untuk menampung jamaah.
Terdapat fatwa MUI Nomor 001 Tahun 2015 tentang pendayagunaan dana
zakat  infaq  shadaqah dan wakaf untuk pengadaan sarana yang bermanfaat dan
mendesak untuk kemaslahatan masyarakat seperti sarana air bersih dan sanitasi.
Fatwa tersebut merupakan produk hukum baru terkait pendistribusian dana zakat.
Hal ini berlandaskan pengambilan maslahah demi kepentingan umat dan menghindari
kemudharatan yang telah terjadi di berbagai daerah. Tujuan utama kehadiran hukum
syari agar dijadikan pedoman utama dalam kehidupannya tidak lain agar manusia
meraih kebaikan (maslahah)  atau dengan kata lain untuk mewujudkan kemaslahatan
umat.
Contoh Soal
Zakat profesi merupakan zakat yang diwajibkan kepada umat islam. Sebab Islam
mengajarkan kepada umat manusia akan kesadaran bahwa harta ini hanya titipan dan
karunia dari Allah swt. Berikut ini pernyataan yang mendukung kewajiban zakat profesi
adalah
1. Zaman dahulu profesi hanya terbatas pada profesi perdagangan  pertanian  emas dan
perak  sehingga kewajiban harta terbatas pada profesi-profesi tersebut  sedangkan
zaman modern hari ini  pertanian sudah banyak ditinggalkan  orang lebih banyak
berprofesi sebagai pegawai dengan keahlian masing-masing. Ada yang insinyur 
dokter  guru dan lain sebagainya. Mereka pun mendapatkan rizki dari profesi yang
dilakukannya  maka mereka pun tetap punya kewajiban terhadap harta tersebut.
2. Pertanian  perdagangan  emas  perak merupakan profesi yang bernilai tinggi 
sedangkan profesi yang berkembang hari ini  hanya profesi yang bernilai rendah 
bahkan penghasilan profesinya banyak penipuan yang dilakukannya  sehingga tidak
ada kewajiban untuk membayarkan zakatnya.
3. Zakat itu untuk membersihkan jiwa dan harta. Dari mana pun harta yang kita hasilkan
hakikatnya adalah dari Allah swt. Untuk bisa membersihkan jiwa dan harta ini  maka
cara yang diajarkan oleh agama adalah mengeluarkan zakatnya.
28

4. Harta yang dikeluarkan untuk zakat haruslah yang bersih dan halal  sebab ia akan
menjadi pembersih  jika kotor yang digunakannya maka akan menjadi kotor badan
dan hartanya. Profesi di dunia modern ini banyak kotornya  dia banyak menipu
orang  banyak kezaliman kepada orang jadi tidak perlu ada kewajiban zakat profesi.
5. Manusia adalah makhluk sosial. Semua harta dan penghasilan yang diterima memuat
Sebagian kecil hak orang lain yang harus disalurkan. Zakat adalah salah satu cara
untuk membersihkan harta yang dimiliki dengan cara menyalurkannya kepada
mereka yang berhak menerimanya.
Diantara pernyataan yang mendukung kewajiban zakat profesi adalah&

A. Konsep Nikah dalam Islam
1. Syariat Pernikahan
Kedudukan nikah dalam Islam merupakan syariat yang terkandung didalamnya
nilai-nilai ibadah. Kelayakan manusia untuk menerima syariat tersebut paling tidak
diperkuat oleh tiga argumen. Pertama  manusia adalah makhluk berakal dan dengan akalnya
tersebut manusia mampu menerima dan menjalankan syariat dengan baik. Di antara syariat
tersebut adalah pernikahan  yang pengertiannya menurut ulama Syafiiyah  sebagai berikut:
 JH2*D'LH'L-'CFD%'L8AD(L!7HD'L)-'(%LFE6*JL/B9
(Akad (perjanjian) yang mengandung kebolehan hubungan kelamin dengan sebab lafaz nikah
atau tajwiz).
Kedua  manusia diciptakan oleh Allah berpasangan  yaitu laki-laki dan perempuan
sebagaimana dijelaskan oleh Allah swt:
LFN HEO DN 9R NJLD'N L'EQN EP HN LER GP 3P OAFRN #LFR EP HN L6O 1R N D#R 'L*O P(FRO*L'EQN EP L'GN QN DCO L N 'HN 2R N D#R 'LBN ND.N LJ0P QN D'LFN '-N (R 3O
Artinya: Maha Suci Tuhan yang telah menciptakan pasangan-pasangan semuanya  baik dari
apa yang ditumbuhkan oleh bumi dan dari diri mereka maupun dari apa yang tidak mereka
ketahui. (QS. Yasin: 36)
Dari kehidupan berpasangan  manusia disyariatkan untuk menjalin hubungan yang
mulia  mengembangkan keturunan  menegaskan hak dan kewajiban antara keduanya. Untuk
itu Allah menurunkan syariat yang bertujuan menjaga harkat dan martabat serta kehormatan
manusia yang disebut dengan nikah.
Ketiga  pernikahan dalam Islam disebut sebagai perilaku para Nabi dan
memasukkannya sebagai salah satu fitrah yang dimiliki oleh manusia. Rasulullah saw
bersabda empat fitrah yang dimiliki oleh manusia  yaitu memakai pacar  wangi-wangian 
bersiwak (gosok gigi)  dan nikah. (al-Hadis)
Untuk dijadikan sebuah perbandingan  sebelum pembahasan nikah menurut Islam
secara lebih mendalam perlu diungkap tentang pernikahan sebelum Islam (Jahiliyah). Pada
zaman Jahiliyah telah dikenal beberapa praktek perkawinan yang merupakan warisan turun
temurun dari perkawinan Romawi dan Persia. Pertama  perkawinan pacaran (khidn)  yaitu
berupa pergaulan bebas pria dan wanita sebelum perkawinan yang resmi dilangsungkan
33

yang tujuannya untuk mengetahui kepribadian masing-masing pasangan. Kedua  nikah badl 
yaitu seorang suami minta kepada laki-laki lain untuk saling menukar istrinya. Ketiga  nikah
istibdha  yaitu seorang suami minta kepada laki-laki kaya  bangsawan atau orang pandai agar
bersedia mengumpuli istrinya yang dalam keadaan suci sampai ia hamil. Setelah itu baru si
suami mengumpulinya. Keempat  nikah Raht (urunan)  seorang wanita dikumpuli oleh
beberapa pria sampai hamil. Ketika anaknya lahir  lalu wanita itu menunjuk salah satu pria
yang telah mengumpulinya untuk mengakui bayi yang telah dilahirkannya sebagai anaknya.
Nikah ini sama dengan nikah baghaaya (nikah pelacur).
Kehadiran Islam menghapus semua bentuk pernikahan di atas karena dipandang
tidak sejalan dengan naluriah dan kehormatan manusia serta dapat dikatakan cara binatang
yang tidak mengenal aturan. Nikah dalam syariat Islam diartikan sebagai sebuah akad yang
menghalalkan pergaulan dan membatasi hak dan kewajiban serta tolong menolong antara
laki-laki dan perempuan yang bukan mahramnya dengan rukun dan syarat yang telah
ditentukan. Al-Quran menyebut nikah sebagai mitsaq (perjanjian) antara suami dan isteri
sejak terjadinya akad. Hal ini dipahami karena keduanya berjanji untuk menjalankan hak dan
kewajiban masing-masing dengan sebaik-baiknya.
'8K JDP:N L'KB'N+JEP LER CO FR EP LFN 0R .N N #HN L6M 9R (N LINDP%LER CO 6O 9R (N LI6N AR N #L/R NBHN LOGNFHO0.O R #N*LAN JR CN HN
Artinya: Bagaimana kamu akan mengambilnya kembali  padahal sebagian kamu telah bergaul
(bercampur) dengan yang lain sebagai suami-isteri. Dan mereka (isteri-isterimu) telah mengambil
dari kamu perjanjian yang kuat. (QS. An-Nisa: 21)
Sepasang calon suami istri yang ingin melangsungkan ikatan pernikahan diharuskan
untuk memenuhi syarat dan rukun nikah. Terkait dengan rukun nikah  para ulama sepakat 
terdapat lima hal yang menjadi rukun nikah. calon suami istri  Wali dari calon isteri  dua
orang saksi  Mahar (mas kawin)  dan Ijab-qabul.
2. Hikmah atau Tujuan Nikah
Setiap syariat yang diturunkan oleh Allah dipastikan terdapat hikmah untuk
kehidupan manusia. Sedikitnya terdapat lima point penting yang penulis kutip dari
pendapat Sayyid Sabiq dalam kitabnya Fiqh Sunnah berkaitan dengan hikmah dari sebuah
pernikahan.
a. Nafsu seks termasuk tuntutan terkuat dan selalu meliputi kehidupan manusia. Ketika
tidak ada jalan keluar untuk melampiaskan  maka manusia akan dirundung
34

kegelisahan dan dikhawatirkan melakukan prostitusi (perzinahan). Maka pernikahan
merupakan aturan yang paling baik dan jalan keluar yang menyejukkan untuk
memuaskan seks manusia. Dengan nikah jasad menjadi segar  jiwa menjadi tentram
dan penglihatan akan menutupi sesuatu yang diharamkan. Ini semua terkandung dari
petunjuk Allah dalam firmanNya:
LJPALFQN P%LK )EN -R 1N HN LK)QN/HN EN LER CO FN JR (N LDN 9N L N HN L'GN JR NDP%L'HOFCO 3R N*DPL' K 'HN 2R N #LER CO 3P OAFRN #LFR EP LER CO NDLBN ND.N LFR N #LGP P*'NJ'!N LFR EP HN
LFN H1O CQN AN N*JN LEM HR NBDPL*M 'NJDNN LCN DPN0
Artinya: Dan di antara tanda-tanda kekuasaan-Nya ialah Dia menciptakan untukmu isteri-isteri
dari jenismu sendiri  supaya kamu cenderung dan merasa tenteram kepadanya  dan dijadikan-Nya
di antaramu rasa kasih dan sayang. Sesungguhnya pada yang demikian itu benar-benar terdapat
tanda-tanda bagi kaum yang berfikir. (QS. ar-Rum: 21)
b. Pernikahan jalan terbaik untuk melahirkan anak  memperbanyak kelahiran dan
melestarikan kehidupan dengan selalu menjaga keturunan.
c. Naluri kebapakan dan keibuan akan tumbuh dan berkembang dalam menaungi anak
masa kanak-kanak serta tumbuhnya rasa kasih-sayang. Semua kelebihan itu tidak
akan sempurna tanpa adanya tali pernikahan.
d. Rasa tanggung jawab dari pernikahan serta mengurus anak dapat membangkitkan
semangat dan mencurahkan segala kemampuan dalam memperkuat potensi diri.
Maka bangkitlah untuk bekerja dengan segala kewajiban sehingga banyak kesibukan
yang dapat menambah harta  kesuksesan dan tergugah semangat untuk
mengeluarkan kekayaan alam dan yang terpendam di dalamnya.
e. Membagi-bagi pekerjaan dan membatasi tanggung jawab pekerjaan kepada suami
dan isteri. Isteri mengurus rumah  hingga tertata dengan rapih  mendidik anak dan
mempersiapkan udara segar untuk suami agar dapat beristirahat yang dapat
menghilangkan kelelahannya dan menimbulkan semangat baru yang dapat
membangkitkan semangat kerja untuk memperoleh harta dan nafkah yang
dibutuhkan. Pembagian kerja yang adil terhadap suami istri sesuai dengan tugas
alamiah mereka masing-masing ini akan diridhai oleh Allah dan pujian manusia serta
menghasilkan buah yang diberkahi.
35

3. Hukum Pernikahan
Penetapan hukum nikah termasuk perkara yang selalu dikaitkan dengan kondisi
orang yang akan melakukannya. Dengan demikian kondisi tersebut dapat dijadikan sebagai
illat hukumnya. Hal yang dapat dimaklumi bahwa kondisi seseorang itu berbeda antara
yang satu dengan yang lainnya jika dilihat dari aspek gejolak seks dan kemampuan
pemberian nafkah. Berangkat dari perbedaan kondisi tersebut maka para ulama
menghukumi nikah itu sesuai dengan illat (sebab) yang ditemui dari seseorang yang akan
melangsungkan pernikahan. Memperhatikan berbagai macam illat nikah maka hukum nikah
dapat ditetapkan sebagai berikut:
a. Wajib  hukum ini layak dibebankan kepada orang yang telah mampu memberi nafkah 
jiwanya terpanggil untuk nikah dan jika tidak nikah khawatir terjerumus ke lembah
perzinahan. Hal ini diperkuat oleh tuntunan agama bahwa menjaga diri dari perbuatan
haram adalah wajib. Sedangkan bagi yang hanya memiliki keinginan yang kuat tapi
belum mampu memberi nafkah  maka lebih baik ia menahan diri. Hal ini didasari oleh
firman Allah swt:
LGP DP6R NALFR EP LO'DDQNLQN LEO GO NJFP :R OJLIQN*-N L'-K 'CN FP LFN HO/NP NJLD'N LFN J0P QN D'LAP AP 9R N*3R NJDR HN
Artinya: Dan orang-orang yang tidak mampu kawin hendaklah menjaga kesucian (diri) nya 
sehingga Allah memampukan mereka dengan karunia-Nya. (QS. An-Nuur: 33)
Salah satu cara untuk menjaga diri ketika gejolak nafsu biologis yang memuncak bagi
orang yang belum layak nikah karena belum mampu menafkahi seperti tersebut di atas.
disarankan agar ia memperbanyak puasa. Hal ini diperkuat oleh Hadits Rasulullah saw
berikut ini:
L P 1R NADR DPLFO 5N -R N'HN L1P 5N N(DR DPL6QO :N N #LOGQNF'P NAL R HQN 2N NL*NJDRNALN)!N 'N(DR'LEO CO FR EP L9N '7N N*3R 'LFP EN L(P 'N(4QN D'L1N 4N 9R EN L'NJ
(I1'.(D'LG'H1)L! ' N HP LOGNDLOGQNF'P NALEP HR 5QN D'P(LGP JR NDN9AN L9R 7P N*3R NJLER NDLFR EN HN
Artinya: Hai para pemuda  siapa diantara kalian yang sudah mampu untuk menikah  maka
menikahlah  karena nikah dapat menahan pandangan dari maksiat dan dapat menjaga
kemaluan dari berbuat zina. Namun bagi siapa yang belum mampu hendaklah ia berpuasa
karena puasa dapat membentengi dorongan sahwat. (HR. Bukhari)
36

b. Sunah  hukum ini pantas bagi orang yang merindukan pernikahan dan mampu memberi
nafkah tapi sebenarnya ia masih mampu menahan dirinya dari perbuatan zina. Maka
bagi orang seperti ini hukum nikah menjadi sunah. Akan tetapi jika demikian kondisinya 
nikah lebih baik baginya dari pada membujang karena dalam nikah terdapat ibadah yang
banyak. Sedangkan membujang (tidak nikah) itu seperti para pendeta Nasrani yang
dilarang oleh Rasulullah.
I1N '5N QNFD'L)P QNJFP 'N(GR 1O CN L'HR OFHR CO N*LND'HN LEO EN OD'R'LEO CO (P L1 +'P CN EO LI PF'P NAL'HR  O HQN 2N N*
Artinya: Nikahlah kamu sekalian karena aku akan berbanyak-banyak umat pada hari Qiamat
dan janganlah kamu seperti pendeta Nasrani.
Memperkuat anjuran nikah  Umar pernah berkata kepada Abi Zawaid  hanya sifat lemah
atau melacurlah yang mencegahmu dari nikah. Berkata juga Ibnu Abbas bahwa tidak
akan sempurna ibadah seseorang sampai ia menikah.
c. Haram  hukum ini layak bagi orang yang tidak mampu memberikan nafkah dan jika ia
memaksakan diri untuk menikah akan mengkhianati isterinya atau suaminya  baik
dalam pemberian nafkah lahiriyah maupun batiniyah  sehingga dengan perkawinan itu
hak-hak istri/suami tidak terpenuhi.
B. Pernikahan Monogami dalam Ajaran Islam
1. Pengertian Monogami
Dalam kamus bahasa Indonesia  monogami berarti sistem yang hanya
memperbolehkan seorang laki-laki mempunyai satu isteri pada jangka waktu tertentu. Dari
tarif atau definisi tersebut dapat dipahami bahwa seorang suami yang beristerikan satu isteri
saja tidak dua atau tiga maka suami itu menganut monogami.
Asas monogami telah ditetapkan oleh Islam sejak lima belas abad yang lalu sebagai
salah satu asas perkawinan dalam Islam. Tujuannya untuk memberikan landasan dan modal
utama dalam pembinaan kehidupan rumah tangga yang harmonis  sejahtera dan bahagia.
Oleh karena itu hukum asal perkawinan dalam Islam adalah monogami. Hukum ini sangatlah
beralasan karena dengan monogami tujuan pernikahan untuk menghantarkan keluarga
bahagia akan lebih mudah karena tidak terlalu banyak beban. Selain dengan bermonogami
juga akan lebih mudah untuk menetralisir dan meredam sifat cemburu  iri hati dan perasaan
mengeluh dalam kehidupan isteri sehari-hari. Islam memerintahkan kepada laki-laki untuk
37

nikah dengan seorang perempuan yang dicintainya. Bagi laki-laki  selayaknya sikap
monogami ini jika tidak ada alasan yang dapat dibenarkan untuk beristeri lebih dari satu 
seperti si isteri ternyata mandul.
2. Dalil dan Hukum Asal Pernikahan Monogami
Pada asalnya hukum Islam menetapkan kepada laki-laki untuk beristeri satu saja.
Isyarat al-Quran untuk bermonogami bagi laki-laki dapat kita pahami dari berbagai ayat al-
Quran yang memerintahkan kepada laki-laki untuk menikah jika sudah mampu  sikap
membujang berkepanjangan tanpa alasan adalah sikap yang tidak dibenarkan karena dalam
nikah banyak terdapat kebaikan. Hal ini dapat dilihat dalam al-Quran antara lain:
LGP DP6R NALLFR EP LO'DDQNLQN LEO GP PF:R OJL!N '1N NBOAL'HOFHCO JN LFR P%LER CO P&'EN %P HN LER CO /P 'N(9P LFR EP LFN J-P DP'5QN D'HN LER CO FR EP LIEN 'NJN D#R 'L'H-O CP FRN #HN
LE JDP9N L9 3P 'HN LO'DDQNQN HN
Artinya: Dan kawinkanlah orang-orang yang sendirian di antara kamu  dan orang-orang yang
layak (berkawin) dari hamba-hamba sahayamu yang lelaki dan hamba-hamba sahayamu yang
perempuan. Jika mereka miskin Allah akan memampukan mereka dengan kurnia-Nya. Dan Allah
Maha Luas (pemberian-Nya) Lagi Maha Mengetahui. (QS. An-Nur 32).
Adapun dasar hukum monogami dalam Islam adalah al-Quran yang menjelaskan
tentang kewajiban berperilaku adil terhadap seorang istri  dan jika khawatir tidak mampu
berperilaku adil maka wajib monogami. Bahkan secara tegas bahwa Allah menyatakan bahwa
para suami tidak akan mampu berbuat adil kepada istri mereka. Hal ini sebagaimana
dijelaskan dalam firman Allah swt berikut ini:

Dan jika kamu takut tidak akan dapat berlaku adil terhadap (hak-hak) perempuan yatim

dua  tiga atau empat. Kemudian jika kamu takut tidak akan berbuat adil  maka (kawinilah) seorang saja
atau budak-budak yang kamu miliki. Yang demikian itu adalah lebih dekat kepada tidak berbuat
aniaya [Q.S. an-Nisa: 3).

memelihara diri (dari kecurangan) maka sesungguhnya Allah Maha Pengampun lagi Maha
Penyayang. [Q.S. an-Nisa (4): 129].
Menurut Yusuf Qardhawi  Islam adalah agama yang sejalan dengan fitrah manusia;
mengakui fakta yang dapat membimbing dan menjauhkan manusia dari perbuatan bodoh.
Sebelum Islam datang  agama-agama terdahulu telah membolehkan praktek poligami sampai
seratus isteri tanpa terikat oleh syarat dan aturan. Itulah kultur yang terjadi di masyarakat
dahulu. Islam datang tidak menghapus secara serta merta sistem poligami Jahiliyah  yang
sudah mendarah daging namun membangun aturan poligami; penerapan pembatasan
jumlah istri tidak boleh lebih dari empat di samping adanya syarat-syarat lain yang
berhubungan dengan keadilan.
Islam turun di tengah-tengah masyarakat jahiliyah dalam kondisi poligami yang
berlebihan dan agar Islam diterima oleh mereka pada saat itu  maka Islam membolehkan
praktik menikah dengan batasan empat orang istri. Dengan demikian  hukum asal
pernikahan dalam Islam adalah monogami. Sebab syarat keadilan menjadi syarat berat bagi
setiap suami yang akan melaksanakan pernikahan lebih dari seorang istri.
C. Poligami dalam Ajaran Islam
1. Pengertian dan Hukum Poligami
Secara kebahasaan yang lebih tepat adalah poligini yang dalam kamus bahasa
Indonesia diartikan sebagai Sistem perkawinan yang membolehkan seorang pria memiliki
beberapa wanita sebagai isterinya di waktu yang bersamaan. Namun dalam tulisan ini 
selanjutnya penulis cenderung untuk menggunakan istilah poligami untuk pembahasan
dimaksud  yaitu poligami yang bermakna pologini (suami beristeri lebih dari satu) karena
selain bisa dibenarkan secara kebahasaan juga istilah tersebut sudah populer penyebutannya
di masyarakat untuk laki-laki yang beristeri lebih dari satu.
Di masyarakat seperti sekarang ini  sikap berpoligami bagi sebagian laki-laki seakan
menjadi sesuatu yang dianggap mudah untuk dilakukan karena hanya semata mengikuti
nafsu biologis dan tidak mengikuti aturan yang sebenarnya. Memang Pada asalnya hukum
poligami itu diperbolehkan jika seseorang suami tidak dikhawatirkan berbuat zhalim
terhadap isteri-isterinya. Jika dipastikan akan berlaku zhalim  maka seorang suami lebih baik
untuk beristeri satu saja.

Islam diperuntukan untuk semua jenis dan golongan manusia serta memelihara
kepentingan dan kemashlahatan yang bersifat pribadi dan umum. Kebolehan poligami untuk
mewujudkan kemashlahatan bagi manusia agar tidak berlaku zina dan tidak terjatuh ke dalam
pintu kemaksiatan. Dengan kata lain menurut Mahmud Syaltut  bahwa pada asalnya Islam
memerintahkan laki-laki untuk beristeri satu  boleh beristeri lebih dari satu jika dipandang
darurat.
Yusuf Qardhawi menjelaskan kondisi darurat yang dengannya seorang laki-laki
dibolehkan berpoligami adalah sebagai berikut: pertama  ditemukan seorang suami yang
menginginkan keturunan  akan tetapi ternyata isterinya tidak dapat melahirkan anak
disebabkan karena mandul atau penyakit. Kedua  Di antara suami ada yang memiliki
overseks  akan tetapi isterinya memiliki kelemahan seks  memiliki penyakit atau masa
haidhnya terlalu panjang sedangkan suaminya tidak sabar menghadapi kelemahan isterinya
tersebut. Ketiga  jumlah wanita lebih banyak dibanding jumlah laki-laki  khususnya setelah
terjadi peperangan. Di situ terdapat kemaslahatan yang harus didapat oleh sebuah
masyarakat dan para wanita yang tidak menginginkan hidup tanpa suami dan keinginan
hidup tenang  cinta dan terlindungi serta menikmati sifat keibuan.
Namun permasalahan yang harus dihadapi bahwa kebolehan seorang suami untuk
beristeri lebih dari satu bukan hanya dikarenakan kondisi mendesak sebagaimana tersebut di
atas. Katakanlah itu adalah pasal yang harus dimiliki oleh seorang suami sebelum
berpoligami. Namun ada pasal penting lainnya yang wajib dipenuhi setelah poligami itu
terealisasi yaitu seorang suami harus berlaku adil dalam memberikan nafkah. Kewajiban bagi
seorang suami untuk berlaku adil dalam memberikan nafkah terhadap isteri-isterinya adalah
konsekuensi dari tindakan berpoligami dalam Islam. Sikap adil dimaksud berarti seorang
suami dapat memenuhi hak kewajibannya terhadap isteri-isterinya secara proporsional
sesuai dengan kebutuhan secara wajar.
Nafkah itu ada yang bersifat lahiriyah  yaitu nafkah yang bersifat materi dan
immateri (batiniyah). Sehubungan dengan pembagian nafkah tersebut maka keadilan pun
terbagi menjadi dua yaitu keadilan dalam memberikan nafkah lahiriyah dan keadilan dalam
memberikan nafkah batiniyah. Pada keadilan bentuk pertama  seorang suami dituntut untuk
berlaku adil terhadap isteri-isterinya dalam memberikan makan  minum  pakaian  rumah 
serta waktu giliran. Pemenuhan rasa keadilan bentuk pertama ini sangat mungkin dapat
dilakukan oleh seorang suami terhadap isteri-isterinya. Maka jika seorang suami tidak dapat
40

berlaku adil dalam nafkah lahir ini yang mengakibatkan isteri-isteri terzalimi  maka haram
bagi laki-laki untuk berpoligami. Allah swt berfirman dalam al-Quran surat al-Nisa ayat 3:
L*R CN NDEN L'LEN LHR N L#LK)N/-P 'HN NAL'HOD/P 9R N*LD'QN N #LER O*AR .P LFR P%NAL9N 'N(1O HN L+N D'N O+HN LINFR +EN L!P '3N PFD'LFN EP LER CO NDL(N '7N L'EN L'H-O CP FR 'NA

Artinya: Kawinilah wanita-wanita (lain) yang kamu senangi: dua  tiga atau empat. Kemudian
jika kamu takut tidak akan dapat berlaku adil  maka (kawinilah) seorang saja  atau budak-budak
yang kamu miliki. Yang demikian itu adalah lebih dekat kepada tidak berbuat aniaya.
Rasulullah bersabda:

Artinya: Siapa yang memiliki dua orang isteri tapi ia lebih berpihak kepada salah satunya  maka
pada hari kiamat ia berjalan dalam keadaan menarik salah satu pundaknya (miring). (HR. Abu
Daud)
Adapun sesuatu yang dianggap perbuatan menzalimi dalam Hadits di atas adalah
ketidak-adilan seorang suami dalam memenuhi hak-hak isteri yang dipandang kuasa bagi
suami untuk memenuhinya seperti nafkah lahir dan waktu gilir.
Terkait dengan keadilan bentuk kedua yakni keadilan yang bersifat batin (LJQO P(DRNBDR'LDO JREN DRN') 
kecenderungan hati/cinta. Usaha untuk berlaku adil dalam membagi cinta kepada isteri-isteri
inilah yang sesungguhnya sangat berat bagi seorang suami. Dan hal ini sudah bisa dipastikan
tidak dapat dilakukan oleh suami untuk berlaku adil sebagaimana diisyaratkan oleh al-
Quran:
L)P NBQN DLN9LEO DR 'CN L'GN H1O N0N*NALDP JR EN DR 'LDQN CO L'HODJEP N*LD'N NALER O*5R 1N -N LHR NDHN L!P '3N PFD'LFN JR (N L'HOD/P 9R N*LFR N #L'HO9J7P N*3R N*LFR NDHN
'EK J-P 1N L'1K HOA:N LFN 'CN LN'DDQNQN LFQN P%NAL'HOBQN*N*HN L'H-O DP5R O*LFR P%HN
Artinya: Dan kamu sekali-kali tidak akan dapat berlaku adil di antara isteri- isteri (mu)  walaupun
kamu sangat ingin berbuat demikian  karena itu janganlah kamu terlalu cenderung (kepada yang
kamu cintai)  sehingga kamu biarkan yang lain terkatung-katung. Dan jika kamu mengadakan
perbaikan dan memelihara diri (dari kecurangan)  maka sesungguhnya Allah Maha Pengampun
lagi Maha Penyayang. (QS. an-Nisa:129)
Kalau seandainya keadilan membagi cinta ini menjadi syarat yang mutlak bagi
seorang suami  maka tertutup hukum kebolehan bagi seorang suami untuk berpoligami
41

meskipun sudah berada pada kondisi yang darurat. Oleh karena sulitnya berlaku adil dalam
membagi cinta  maka Menurut Yusuf Qardhawi ini adalah keadilan yang dimaafkan dan
diberikan toleransi  namun tidak termaafkan untuk nafkah lahir.
Ayat ini juga dapat dipahami bahwa seorang suami yang berpoligami tidak hanya
untuk berkomitmen untuk adil  karena ayat tersebut memastikan bahwa siapapun seorang
suami tidak akan pernah bisa berbuat adil kepada isteri-isterinya  karena itu penting
keharusan adanya maslahat yang lebih besar untuk isteri-isteri dan anak-anaknya. Perhatikan
bagaimana tingginya konflik berumah tangga bagi para suami yang beristeri lebih dari satu 
perseteruan antara para isteri  kecemburuan buta  permusuhan antara para anak  perebutan
harta waris dan dosa-dosa yang ditimbulkan akibat perilaku berpoligami. Karena itu 
pikirkan kemaslahatan yang lebih penting jika melakukan poligami seperti untuk
kepentingan dakwah  mendapatkan keturunan hebat  dan kemaslahatan buat seluruh
anggota keluarganya.
Contoh praktik poligami ideal adalah Baginda Rasulullah saw yang selalu berusaha
untuk berlaku adil sampai kepada masalah bepergian dan untuk memenuhi rasa keadilan
tersebut  Rasulullah mengundi di antara isteri-isterinya. Bagi yang keluar undiannya  maka
dialah yang menjadi teman pergi Rasulullah  hal ini dilakukan oleh Rasulullah supaya tidak
melukai perasaan dan meminta kerelaan dari isteri-isteri yang tidak pergi bersama Rasul.
Bukan hanya itu  Beliau berpoligami hanya semata untuk kepentingan dakwah sebab istri-
istri yang dinikahi oleh beliau adalah wanita-wanita yang sangat memerlukan bantuan 
lihatlah sosok wanita yang beliau nikahi semuanya adalah janda kecuali Sayyidatina Aisyah
r.a.
Meskipun poligami diizinkan dalam ajaran Islam dengan syarat-syarat ketat  tetapi
realitasnya ternyata menyisakan penderitaan bagi istri  orang tua dan anak-anak. Hancurnya
rumah tangga dan putusnya cinta kasih di antara mereka  bahkan anak yang tidak berdosa
pun sering menjadi korban. Karena itu  poligami hendaknya dihindari oleh setiap suami 
sebab mengandung kemudharatan bagi setiap anggota keluarga. Hal ini terungkap dalam
hadis Nabi SAW Riwayat Imam al-Bukhari  Muslim  Turmudzi dan Ibnu Majah dari Miswar
bin Makhramah yang mengangkat peristiwa yang dialami keluarga putri Nabi SAW
(Fatimah) ketika Ali akan melakukan poligami.
Miswar bin Makhramah bercerita bahwa ia mendengar Rasulullah SAW berdiri di atas
mimbar seraya berkata  Sesungguhnya keluarga Hisyam bin al-Mughirah meminta izinku untuk
42

menikahkan putrinya dengan Ali bin Abi Thalib. Aku tidak izinkan. Aku tidak izinkan. Aku tidak
izinkan. Kecuali jika Ali bin Abi Thalib lebih memilih menceraikan putriku dan menikah dengan
putrinya (Keluarga Hisyam). Sesungguhnya putriku adalah darah dagingku  menyusahkannya berarti
menyusahkanku dan menyakitinya berarti menyakitiku [H.R. al-Bukhari  Muslim  at-Turmudzi
dan Ibnu Majah].
Hadits di atas mempertegas prinsip monogami dalam pernikahan. Nabi SAW
melarang Ali bin Abi Thalib untuk melakukan poligami  bahkan beliau meminta Ali memilih
menceraikan Fatimah putri Nabi jika tetap menikahi gadis tersebut. Alasan yang diajukan
Rasulullah adalah beliau tidak rela andaikan poligami itu akan menyusahkan dan menyakiti
putri tercintanya Fatimah  yang berarti menyakiti perasaan Rasulullah SAW sebagai ayahnya.
Jika kedua kelompok hadis di atas digabungkan  dapat dipahami bahwa hadis-hadis
tentang poligami tidak menyebutkan bahwa poligami itu perbuatan sunah atau yang
dianjurkan. Poligami dalam Islam merupakan ketentuan pembatasan yang pernah terjadi
sebelumnya (yang tidak terbatas). Poligami dilakukan dengan memenuhi ketentuan adil.
2. Hikmah dari Poligami
Berpoligami bagi sebagian orang terkadang tidak terlalu sulit untuk dilakukan.
Permasalahannya adalah tidak mudah untuk berlaku adil dalam memenuhi sesuatu yang
menjadi hak para isteri. Terlihat  banyak suami yang beristeri lebih dari satu tapi sebenarnya
mereka tidak mampu untuk memberikan nafkah. Motif mereka berpoligami bukan karena
masalah darurat  tapi karena ingin memperturutkan hawa nafsu seksual. Kalaupun mereka
mampu memberikan nafkah namun terkadang perlakuan suami kepada isteri-isterinya
banyak berlaku tidak adil dalam pemenuhan kebutuhan seperti makan  pakaian  tempat
tinggal  dan waktu bergilir.
Oleh karena itu  alasan kebolehan berpoligami bagi sang suami dikarenakan terdapat
kondisi darurat dan syarat berlaku adil terdapat hikmah di dalamnya. Rasyid Ridha
mengemukakan empat hikmah. 1) Untuk mendapatkan anak bagi suami yang subur dan
isteri yang mandul. 2). Menjaga keutuhan keluarga tanpa harus mencerai isteri pertama meski
ia tidak berfungsi semestinya sebagai isteri karena cacat fisik dan sebagainya. 3). Untuk
menyelamatkan suami yang hiperseks dari perbuatan free sex. Tercatat di beberapa negara
Barat yang melarang poligami mengakibatkan merajalelanya praktek prostitusi dan free sex
(kumpul kebo) dan lahirnya anak-zina yang mencapai jumlah cukup tinggi. 4).
43

Menyelamatkan harkat dan martabat wanita dari krisis akhlak (melacur)  terutama bagi
mereka yang tinggal di negara yang jumlah wanitanya lebih banyak dibanding laki-laki
akibat peperangan misalnya.
Sedangkan hikmah kebolehan Rasulullah beristeri lebih dari empat bukanlah karena
dorongan hawa nafsu sebagaimana yang dituduhkan oleh kaum orientalis  tapi mengandung
hikmah yang besar  yaitu kepentingan dakwah Islam sebagaimana dikemukakan oleh Abbas
Mahmud al-Aqqad sebagai berikut:
a. Untuk kepentingan pendidikan dan pengajaran agama. Semua isteri Nabi yang
berjumlah sembilan dapat dijadikan sumber informasi bagi umat Islam yang hendak
mengetahui ajaran-ajaran Nabi dan praktek kehidupan beliau dalam berkeluarga 
bermasyarakat  terutama masalah rumah tangga.
b. Untuk kepentingan politik  yaitu mempersatukan suku-suku bangsa Arab dan sekaligus
menarik mereka masuk Islam. Seperti perkawinan Nabi dengan Juwairiyah putri al-Harist
kepala suku bani al-Musthaliq dan Shafiyah  seorang tokoh dari Bani Quiraizhah dan Bani
al-Nadhir.
c. Untuk kepentingan sosial dan kamanusiaan. Seperti perkawinan beliau dengan janda
dermawan bernama Khadijah dan janda pahlawan Islam seperti Saudah binti Zumaah
(suaminya meninggal setelah kembali dari hijrah ke Abesenia)  Hafsah binti Umar
(suaminya gugur pada perang badar)  Hindun Ummu Salamah (suaminya gugur di
perang Uhud).
Seandainya saja motif Rasul untuk menikah lebih dari satu karena dorongan sex 
mungkin wanita yang dinikahi adalah gadis-gadis cantik bangsa Arab. Tetapi hal itu sama
sekali tidak dilakukan oleh Rasulullah tapi justru dengan Siti khadijah yang umurnya lebih
tua 15 tahun dibandingkan umur beliau. Demikian dengan isteri-isteri beliau yang lain 
semuanya dinikahi bukan karena tuntutan nafsu  tapi bermotif dakwah yang ternyata motif
tersebut dapat membantu keberhasilan tugas beliau sebagai utusan Allah. Dengan demikian 
pada pernikahan Rasul terdapat hikmah yang tinggi yang bernilai dakwah  pendidikan dan
sosial kemasyarakatan. Argumentasi logis di atas dapat meruntuhkan segala tuduhan
negatif yang dilontarkan oleh kaum orientalis terhadap kebolehan rasul bersiteri lebih dari
satu.
44

Lebih lanjut Al-Jarjawi menguraikan pula hikmah pembatasan poligami sampai
empat orang istri  yaitu: pertama  jumlah empat istri merupakan kompilasi dari empat unsur
bumi dan merupakan simbol atas kesinambungan spesies manusia. Kedua  jumlah empat
sesuai dengan sumber nafkah yakni kepemimpinan  perdagangan  pertanian dan industri.
Ketiga  empat adalah jumlah pembagian cuaca dalam setahun  pergantian yang memperbaiki
semua sendi kehidupan manusia  kehidupan tumbuhan  dan kehidupan binatang. Keempat 
empat orang istri dianggap cukup untuk mendapatkan setiap mereka satu hari kemudian
menanti dalam rentang waktu tiga hari lainnya. Rentang waktu tiga hari ini dirasa cukup
untuk menumbuhkan kerinduan dan kasih sayang. Seorang istri tidak bisa menanti lebih dari
waktu tersebut. Kelima  sesungguhnya syariat menjadikan jumlah tiga sebagai tambahan
karena ia sudah menjadi satu standarisasi umum dalam banyak hukum di berbagai negara.
Poligami dengan batasan empat orang istri memang diperbolehkan oleh syariat
Muhammad tetapi dengan syarat berlaku adil kepada semua istrinya. Tetapi waspadalah 
Ketika suami tidak mampu memberikan hak yang sama pada setiap istrinya  maka
terkoyaklah urusan rumah tangganya dan buruklah bahtera rumah tangganya pada akhirnya
akan membawa permasalahan besar bagi setiap anggota keluarganya. Para istri pun
disibukkan dengan pertengkaran antara mereka  memperebutkan harta suaminya  sehingga
melupakan kewajiban mereka untuk mengatur rumah tangga. Itulah aspek-aspek yang
menjadi pertimbangan seorang berpoligami. Karena itulah surat an-Nisa ayat 3 secara tegas
&.Kemudian jika kamu takut tidak akan dapat berlaku adil  maka kawinilah seorang saja.
(QS. An-Nisa:3).
D. Konsep Nikah Mutah
Semarak nikah mutah atau sering disebut dengan nikah kontrak nampaknya masih
menghiasi kehidupan sebagian kecil masyarakat. Keprihatinan dan kekhawatiran pun
muncul dari orang tua  tokoh masyarakat  pendidik bahkan ulama terhadap pernikahan yang
terkesan main-main ini. Praktek nikah mutah seperti tersebut terjadi selain karena terdapat
legitimasi dari kelompok yang membolehkan  juga ditemukan alasan untuk terhindar dari
perzinahan demi memenuhi tuntutan sex sesaat. Untuk dapat menguji keabsahan nikah
mutah yang banyak dilakukan oleh orang yang tinggal jauh dari isterinya karena memenuhi
45

tugas kerja misalnya  bahkan tak luput pelakunya adalah pemuda dan mahasiswa  berikut
ini akan dijelaskan tentang hukum nikah mutah.
1. Pengertian dan Dasar Nikah Mutah.
Kata mutah ( L)N9R*EO )  berasal dari bahasa Arab yang mempunyai arti antara lain bekal
yang sedikit dan barang yang menyenangkan. Pengertian ini sejalan dengan kata mutah yang
terdapat dalam al-Quran yang berarti bercampur (bersenang-senang bersama istri dengan
bersenggama) dan pemberian yang menyenangkan oleh suami kepada isterinya yang dicerai.
Firman Allah swt:
L'9K 'N*EN LOG1O N/NBL1P P*LBREO DR'LIND9N HNL1O N/NBL P93P HEO DR'LINDL9N LFQN GO HO9 P*EN HNLK)6N J1P NALFQN GO NDL'H6O 1P ARN*LHRN#LFQN GO H3QO EN N*LERNDL'EN L!N '3N P FD'LEOO*BRQND7N LFR P%LERCO JRND9N L-N 'NF O LD'N
(232)LFN JPF3P -R EO DR'LIND9N L'QKB-N LAP H1O 9R EN DR'P(
Artinya: Tidak ada kewajiban membayar (mahar) atas kamu  jika kamu menceraikan isteri-
isterimu sebelum kamu bercampur dengan mereka dan sebelum kamu menentukan maharnya. Dan
hendaklah kamu berikan suatu mut`ah (pemberian) kepada mereka. Orang yang mampu menurut
kemampuannya dan orang yang miskin menurut kemampuannya (pula)  yaitu pemberian menurut
yang patut. Yang demikian itu merupakan ketentuan bagi orang-orang yang berbuat kebajikan.
(QS. Al-Baqarah: 236)
Yusuf Qardhawi memberikan pengertian nikah mutah secara terminologi  yaitu
seorang laki-laki mengikat (menikahi) seorang perempuan untuk waktu yang ditentukan
dengan imbalan uang yang tertentu pula. Di Indonesia  kawin mutah ini popular dengan
sebutan kawin kontrak.
Uraian di atas memberikan gambaran cukup jelas tentang nikah mutah. Bahwa
tidaklah nikah mutah itu dilakukan  kecuali kecenderungan seseorang untuk memenuhi
kebutuhan seksual  berakhir tanpa talak (cerai) karena secara otomatis jika sudah habis waktu
kontrak yang telah ditentukan maka berakhir lah riwayat pernikahan itu. Dilihat dari
penetapan pembatasan waktu (taqit) tersebut  pernikahan semacam itu bertentangan
dengan syariat Islam yang menghendaki pernikahan itu tidak terbatas oleh waktu.
2. Hukum Nikah Mutah
Nikah mutah pada zaman Nabi diperbolehkan namun tidak berlaku untuk semua
orang hanya untuk orang tertentu dikarenakan terdapat suatu kondisi yang sangat mendesak.
Menurut Yusuf Qardhawi  rahasia diperbolehkan nikah mutah pertama kali pada zaman
Nabi  karena umat ketika itu berada pada masa transisi dari dunia Jahiliyah ke dunia Islam.
46

Pada zaman Jahiliyah  perzinahan merupakan budaya yang sudah menyebar luas. Ketika
Islam mewajibkan kepada kaum untuk pergi berjihad  mereka merasakan sangat berat tinggal
jauh dengan isteri-isteri mereka. Di antara kaum yang ikut berijihad dengan Rosulullah itu
ada yang memiliki iman yang kuat dan ada yang lemah. Mereka yang lemah imannya sangat
takut terjerumus ke jurang perzinahan. Sedangkan mereka yang kuat imannya bersikeras
untuk menghilangkan nafsu seksnya dengan cara mengebiri  sebagaimana informasi Hadits
yang diriwayatkan oleh Ibnu masud:
L(P LHRQN+D'P(LN)N#1R EN DR'L-N CP FRNFLLLLLLLFR N#L'NFNDLL5N .QN 1N HNLCN DPNL'0LFR 9N LP'DDGLDO HR3O 1N L'NF'GN NFNALJN 5P .R N*3R NFLQND'N#L'NFDROBNAL! '3N PFL'NFN9EN L3N JRNDHNLP'DDGLDP HR3O 1N L9N EN LH2O :R NFL'QNFCO
(GJD9LBA*E)LDM  N N#LINDP'
Artinya: Kami ikut berperang dengan Rosulullah dan istri-istri kami tidak ada di samping kami.
Kemudian kami bertanya kepada Rosulullah  bolehkah kami mengebiri? Maka Rosulullah melarang
kami untuk mengebiri dan memberikan keringanan kepada kami untuk menikahi perempuan
dengan membayar imbalan untuk waktu yang ditentukan. (HR. Bukhari Muslim)
Berdasarkan keterangan di atas  maka jelaslah bahwa kebolehan hukum nikah mutah
pada zaman Nabi itu memiliki alasan sebagai berikut:
a. Merupakan keringanan hukum (rukhsah) untuk memberikan jalan keluar dari
problematika yang dihadapi oleh dua kelompok orang yang imannya kuat dan imannya
lemah.
b. Sebagai langkah perjalanan hukum Islam menuju ditetapkannya kehidupan rumah
tangga yang sempurna untuk mewujudkan semua tujuan pernikahan yaitu melestarikan
keturunan  cinta kasih sayang dan memperluas pergaulan melalui perbesanan.
Terkait dengan hukumnya  dilihat dari prosesnya nampaknya langkah pengharaman
nikah mutah yang ditempuh oleh Islam dilakukan secara periodik seperti proses
pengharaman khamar. Rasulullah SAW memperbolehkan nikah mutah dalam kondisi
tertentu (darurat)  kemudian Rasulullah SAW mengharamkan nikah mutah sebagai bentuk
pernikahan. Sebagaimana Hadits yang diriwayatkan oleh Imam Muslim dalam Shahihnya
dari Syibrah al-Juhani bahwasanya ia berperang bersama Rasulullah saw pada waktu fathu
Makkah  maka Rasulullah mengizinkan mereka untuk melakukan nikah mutah. Ia berkata:
Maka kaum tetap melakukan nikah mutah itu sampai Rasulullah mengharamkan nikah
mutah. Dan dalam redaksi yang lain  terdapat Hadits yang berbunyi

Heading: Konsep Nikah dalam Islam

1. Syariat Pernikahan
Kedudukan nikah dalam Islam merupakan syariat yang terkandung didalamnya nilai-nilai ibadah. Kelayakan manusia untuk menerima syariat tersebut paling tidak diperkuat oleh tiga argumen:
1. Manusia adalah makhluk berakal dan dengan akalnya tersebut manusia mampu menerima dan menjalankan syariat dengan baik. Salah satu syariat tersebut adalah pernikahan  yang pengertiannya menurut ulama Syafi'iyah adalah akad (perjanjian) yang mengandung kebolehan hubungan kelamin dengan sebab lafaz nikah atau tajwiz.
2. Manusia diciptakan oleh Allah berpasangan  yaitu laki-laki dan perempuan  untuk menjalin hubungan yang mulia  mengembangkan keturunan  dan menegaskan hak serta kewajiban antara keduanya.
3. Pernikahan dalam Islam disebut sebagai perilaku para Nabi dan memasukkannya sebagai salah satu fitrah yang dimiliki oleh manusia.

Sebelum Islam  di zaman Jahiliyah telah dikenal beberapa praktek perkawinan yang merupakan warisan turun temurun dari perkawinan Romawi dan Persia  seperti perkawinan pacaran (khidn)  nikah badl  nikah istibdha  dan nikah Raht (urunan). Kehadiran Islam menghapus semua bentuk pernikahan di atas karena dipandang tidak sejalan dengan naluriah dan kehormatan manusia serta dapat dikatakan cara binatang yang tidak mengenal aturan. Nikah dalam syariat Islam diartikan sebagai sebuah akad yang menghalalkan pergaulan dan membatasi hak dan kewajiban serta tolong menolong antara laki-laki dan perempuan yang bukan mahramnya dengan rukun dan syarat yang telah ditentukan.

2. Hikmah atau Tujuan Nikah
Terdapat lima poin penting berkaitan dengan hikmah dari sebuah pernikahan:
a. Nafsu seks termasuk tuntutan terkuat dan selalu meliputi kehidupan manusia. Ketika tidak ada jalan keluar untuk melampiaskan  maka manusia akan dirundung kesulitan.
b. Hukum nikah menjadi sunah bagi orang yang merindukan pernikahan dan mampu memberi nafkah tapi sebenarnya ia masih mampu menahan dirinya dari perbuatan zina.
c. Hukum nikah menjadi haram bagi orang yang tidak mampu memberikan nafkah dan jika ia memaksakan diri untuk menikah akan mengkhianati isterinya atau suaminya  baik dalam pemberian nafkah lahiriyah maupun batiniyah.

URAIAN MATERI
URAIAN MATERI
Saudara Mahasiswa pada bahan Kegiatan Belajar 2 akan dibahas empat materi
pokok. Pada bagian pertama akan dibahas tentang syariat pernikahan menurut Islam 
bagian kedua monogami  bagian ketiga poligami  dan bagian keempat akan dibahas
tentang nikah mutah. Hukum nikah pun menjadi hukum agama yang diatur dalam
hukum Negara Kesatuan Republik Indonesia (NKRI). Apakah asas pernikahan dalam
Islam monogami atau poligami? Lalu bagaimana juga dengan hukum nikah yang
hanya punya waktu terbatas (nikah mutah)? Apakah agama dan negara menolak
hukum nikah mutah ini? Untuk lebih memahami persoalan ini  silahkan pelajari
modul di Kegiatan belajar 2.
URAIAN MATERI
A. Konsep Nikah dalam Islam
1. Syariat Pernikahan
Kedudukan nikah dalam Islam merupakan syariat yang terkandung
didalamnya nilai-nilai ibadah. Kelayakan manusia untuk menerima syariat tersebut
paling tidak diperkuat oleh tiga argumen. Pertama  manusia adalah makhluk berakal
dan dengan akalnya tersebut manusia mampu menerima dan menjalankan syariat
dengan baik. Di antara syariat tersebut adalah pernikahan  yang pengertiannya
menurut ulama Syafiiyah  sebagai berikut:
 JH2*D' H' -'CFD%' 8AD( !7HD' )-('% FE6*J /B9
(Akad (perjanjian) yang mengandung kebolehan hubungan kelamin dengan sebab lafaz nikah
atau tajwiz).
Kedua  manusia diciptakan oleh Allah berpasangan  yaitu laki-laki dan
perempuan sebagaimana dijelaskan oleh Allah swt:
FN HEO ND9R NJ DNN 'EQN EP HN ER GP 3P OAFRN# FR EP HN 6O 1R NDRR' *O P(FRO* 'EQN EP 'GN QNDCO  N 'HN 2R NDRR' BN ND.N J0P QND' FN '-N (R3O
3

Artinya: Maha Suci Tuhan yang telah menciptakan pasangan-pasangan semuanya  baik
dari apa yang ditumbuhkan oleh bumi dan dari diri mereka maupun dari apa yang tidak
mereka ketahui. (QS. Yasin: 36)
Dari kehidupan berpasangan  manusia disyariatkan untuk menjalin
hubungan yang mulia  mengembangkan keturunan  menegaskan hak dan kewajiban
antara keduanya. Untuk itu Allah menurunkan syariat yang bertujuan menjaga
harkat dan martabat serta kehormatan manusia yang disebut dengan nikah.
Ketiga  pernikahan dalam Islam disebut sebagai prilaku para Nabi dan
memasukkannya sebagai salah satu fitrah yang dimiliki oleh manusia. Rasulullah saw
bersabda empat fitrah yang dimiliki oleh manusia  yaitu memakai pacar  wangi-
wangian  bersiwak (gosok gigi)  dan nikah. (al-Hadis).
Untuk dijadikan sebuah perbandingan  sebelum pembahasan nikah menurut
Islam secara lebih mendalam perlu diungkap tentang pernikahan sebelum Islam
(Jahiliyah). Pada zaman Jahiliyah telah dikenal bebarapa praktek perkawinan yang
merupakan warisan turun temurun dari perkawinan Romawi dan Persia. Pertama 
perkawinan pacaran (khidn)  yaitu berupa pergaulan bebas pria dan wanita sebelum
perkawinan yang resmi dilangsungkan yang tujuannya untuk mengetahui
kepribadian masing-masing pasangan. Kedua  nikah badl  yaitu seorang suami minta
kepada laki-laki lain untuk saling menukar istrinya. Ketiga  nikah istibdha  yaitu
seorang suami minta kepada laki-laki kaya  bangsawan atau orang pandai agar
bersedia mengumpuli istrinya yang dalam keadaan suci sampai ia hamil. Setelah itu
baru si suami mengumpulinya. Keempat  nikah Raht (urunan)  seorang wanita
dikumpuli oleh beberapa pria sampai hamil. Ketika anaknya lahir  lalu wanita itu
menunjuk salah satu pria yang telah mengumpulinya untuk mengakui bayi yang
telah dilahirkannya sebagai anaknya. Nikah ini sama dengan nikah baghaaya (nikah
pelacur).
Kehadiran Islam menghapus semua bentuk pernikahan di atas karena
dipandang tidak sejalan dengan naluriah dan kehormatan manusia serta dapat
dikatakan cara binatang yang tidak mengenal aturan. Itulah nilai moderat dalam
Islam. Nikah dalam syariat Islam diartikan sebagai sebuah aqad yang menghalalkan
pergaulan dan membatasi hak dan kewajiban serta tolong menolong antara laki-laki
4

dan perempuan yang bukan mahromnya dengan rukun dan syarat yang telah
ditentukan. Al-Quran menyebut nikah sebagai mitsaq (perjanjian) antara suami dan
isteri sejak terjadinya akad. Hal ini dipahami karena keduanya berjanji untuk
menjalankan hak dan kewajiban masing-masing dengan sebaik-baiknya.

Artinya: Bagaimana kamu akan mengambilnya kembali  padahal sebagian kamu telah
bergaul (bercampur) dengan yang lain sebagai suami-isteri. Dan mereka (isteri-isterimu)
telah mengambil dari kamu perjanjian yang kuat. (QS. An-Nisa: 21)
Sepasang calon suami istri yang ingin melangsungkan ikatan pernikahan
diharuskan untuk memenuhi syarat dan rukun nikah. Terkait dengan rukun nikah 
para ulama sepakat  terdapat lima hal yang menjadi rukun nikah. calon suami istri 
Wali dari calon isteri  dua orang saksi  Mahar (mas kawin)  dan Ijab-qabul.
2. Hikmah atau Tujuan Nikah
Setiap syariat yang diturunkan oleh Allah dipastikan terdapat hikmah untuk
kehidupan manusia. Sedikitnya terdapat lima point penting yang penulis kutip dari
pendapat Sayyid Sabiq dalam kitabnya Fiqh Sunah berkaitan dengan hikmah dari
sebuah pernikahan.
a. Nafsu seks termasuk tuntutan terkuat dan selalu meliputi kehidupan manusia.
Ketika tidak ada jalan keluar untuk melampiaskan  maka manusia akan
dirundung kegelisahan dan dikhawatirkan melakukan prostitusi (perzinahan).
Maka pernikahan merupakan aturan yang paling baik dan jalan keluar yang
menyejukkan untuk memuaskan seks manusia. Dengan nikah jasad menjadi
segar  jiwa menjadi tentram dan penglihatan akan menutupi sesuatu yang
diharamkan. Ini semua terkandung dari petunjuk Allah dalam firmanNya:

Artinya: Dan di antara tanda-tanda kekuasaan-Nya ialah Dia menciptakan untukmu
isteri-isteri dari jenismu sendiri  supaya kamu cenderung dan merasa tenteram kepadanya 
dan dijadikan-Nya di antaramu rasa kasih dan sayang. Sesungguhnya pada yang demikian
itu benar-benar terdapat tanda-tanda bagi kaum yang berfikir. (QS. ar-Rum: 21)

b. Pernikahan jalan terbaik untuk melahirkan anak  memperbanyak kelahiran
dan melestarikan kehidupan dengan selalu menjaga keturunan.
c. Naluri kebapakan dan keibuan akan tumbuh dan berkembang dalam
menaungi anak masa kanak-kanak serta tumbuhnya rasa kasih-sayang. Semua
kelebihan itu tidak akan sempurna tanpa adanya tali pernikahan.
d. Rasa tanggung jawab dari pernikahan serta mengurus anak dapat
membangkitkan semangat dan mencurahkan segala kemampuan dalam
memperkuat potensi diri. Maka bangkitlah untuk bekerja dengan segala
kewajiban sehingga banyak kesibukan yang dapat menambah harta 
kesuksesan dan tergugah semangat untuk mengeluarkan kekayaan alam dan
yang terpendam di dalamnya.
e. Membagi-bagi pekerjaan dan membatasi tanggung jawab pekerjaan kepada
suami dan isteri. Isteri mengurus rumah  hingga tertata dengan rapih 
mendidik anak dan mempersiapkan udara segar untuk suami agar dapat
beristirahat yang dapat menghilangkan kelelahannya dan menimbulkan
semangat baru yang dapat membangkitkan semangat kerja untuk memperoleh
harta dan nafkah yang dibutuhkan. Pembagian kerja yang adil terhadap suami
istri sesuai dengan tugas alamiah mereka masing-masing ini akan diridhai oleh
Allah dan pujian manusia serta menghasilkan buah yang diberkahi.
3. Hukum Pernikahan
Penetapan hukum nikah termasuk perkara yang selalu dikaitkan dengan
kondisi orang yang akan melakukannya. Dengan demikian kondisi tersebut dapat
dijadikan sebagai illat hukumnya. Hal yang dapat dimaklumi bahwa kondisi
seseorang itu berbeda antara yang satu dengan yang lainnya jika dilihat dari aspek
gejolak seks dan kemampuan pemberian nafkah. Berangkat dari perbedaan kondisi
tersebut maka para ulama menghukumi nikah itu sesuai dengan illat (sebab) yang
ditemui dari seseorang yang akan melangsungkan pernikahan. Memperhatikan
berbagai macam illat nikah maka hukum nikah dapat ditetapkan sebagai berikut:
a. Wajib  hukum ini layak dibebankan kepada orang yang telah mampu memberi
nafkah  jiwanya terpanggil untuk nikah dan jika tidak nikah khawatir terjerumus
6

ke lembah perzinahan. Hal ini diperkuat oleh tuntunan agama bahwa menjaga
diri dari perbuatan haram adalah wajib. Sedangkan bagi yang hanya memiliki
keinginan yang kuat tapi belum mampu memberi nafkah  maka lebih baik ia
menahan diri. Hal ini didasari oleh firman Allah swt:

Salah satu cara untuk menjaga diri ketika gejolak nafsu bilogis yang memuncak

Artinya: Hai para pemuda  siapa diantara kalian yang sudah mampu untuk menikah 
maka menikahlah  karena nikah dapat menahan pandangan dari maksiat dan dapat
menjaga kemaluan dari berbuat zina. Namun bagi siapa yang belum mampu hendaklah
ia berpuasa karena puasa dapat membentengi dorongan sahwat. (HR. Bukhari)
b. Sunah  hukum ini pantas bagi orang yang merindukan pernikahan dan mampu
memberi nafkah tapi sebenarnya ia masih mampu menahan dirinya dari
perbuatan zina. Maka bagi orang seperti ini hukum nikah menjadi sunah. Akan
tetapi jika demikian kondisinya  nikah lebih baik baginya dari pada membujang
karena dalam nikah terdapat ibadah yang banyak. Sedangkan membujang (tidak
nikah) itu seperti para pendeta Nasrani yang dilarang oleh Rasulullah.

c. Haram  hukum ini layak bagi orang yang tidak mampu memberikan nafkah dan
jika ia memaksakan diri utnuk menikah akan mengkhianati isterinya atau
suaminya  baik dalam pemberian nafkah lahiriyah maupun batiniyah  sehingga
dengan perkawinan itu hak-hak istri/suami tidak terpenuhi.
B. Monogami dalam Ajaran Islam
1. Pengertian Monogami
Dalam kamus bahasa Indonesia  monogami berarti sistem yang
memperbolehkan seorang laki-laki mempunyai satu isteri pada jangka waktu
tertentu. Dari tarif tersebut dapat dipahami bahwa seorang suami yang beristerikan
satu isteri saja tidak dua atau tiga maka suami itu menganut monogami.
Azas monogami telah ditetapkan oleh Islam sejak lima belas abad yang lalu
sebagai salah satu asas perkawinan dalam Islam. Tujuannya untuk memberikan
landasan dan modal utama dalam pembinaan kehidupan rumah tangga yang
harmonis  sejahtera dan bahagia. Oleh karena itu hukum asal perkawinan dalam
Islam adalah monogami. Hukum ini sangatlah beralasan karena dengan monogami
tujuan pernikahan untuk menghantarkan keluarga bahagia akan lebih mudah karena
tidak terlalu banyak beban. Selain dengan bermonogami juga akan lebih mudah
untuk menetralisir dan meredam sifat cemburu  iri hati dan perasaan mengeluh
dalam kehidupan isteri sehari-hari. Islam memerintahkan kepada laki-laki untuk
nikah dengan seorang perempuan yang dicintainya. Bagi laki-laki  selayaknya sikap
monogami ini yang dipegang teguh jika tidak ada alasan yang dapat dibenarkan
untuk beristeri lebih dari satu  seperti si isteri ternyata mandul.
2. Dalil dan Hukum Asal Pernikahan Monogami
Pada asalnya hukum Islam menetapkan kepada laki-laki untuk beristeri satu
saja. Isyarat al-Quran untuk bermonogami bagi laki-laki dapat kita pahami dari
berbagai ayat al-Quran yang memerintahkan kepada laki-laki untuk menikah jika
sudah mampu  sikap membujang berkepanjangan tanpa alasan adalah sikap yang
tidak dibenarkan karena dalam nikah banyak terdapat kebaikan. Hal ini dapat dilihat
dalam al-Quran antara lain:

Artinya: Dan kawinkanlah orang-orang yang sendirian di antara kamu  dan orang-orang
yang layak (berkawin) dari hamba-hamba sahayamu yang lelaki dan hamba-hamba
sahayamu yang perempuan. Jika mereka miskin Allah akan memampukan mereka dengan
kurnia-Nya. Dan Allah Maha Luas (pemberian-Nya) Lagi Maha Mengetahui. (QS. An-
Nur 32).
Adapun dasar hukum monogami dalam Islam adalah al-Quran yang
menjelaskan tentang kewajiban berperilaku adil terhadap seorang istri  dan jika
khawatir tidak mampu berperilaku adil maka wajib monogami. Bahkan secara tegas
bahwa Allah menyatakan bahwa para suami tidak akan mampu berbuat adil kepada
istri mereka. Hal ini sebagaimana dijelaskan dalam firman Allah swt berikut ini:
Dan jika kamu takut tidak akan dapat berlaku adil terhadap (hak-hak) perempuan
yatim (bilamana kamu mengawininya)  maka kawinilah perempuan-perempuan (lain) yang
kamu senangi; dua  tiga atau empat. Kemudian jika kamu takut tidak akan berbuat adil  maka
(kawinilah) seorang saja atau budak-budak yang kamu miliki. Yang demikian itu adalah lebih
dekat kepada tidak berbuat aniaya [Q.S. an-Nisa: 3).
Dan kamu sekali-kali tidak akan dapat berlaku adil di antara istri-istri (mu) 
walaupun kamu sangat ingin berbuat demikian  karena itu janganlah kamu terlalu cenderung
(kepada yang kamu cintai)  sehingga kamu biarkan yang lain terkatung-katung. Dan jika kamu
mengadakan perbaikan dan memelihara diri (dari kecurangan) maka sesungguhnya Allah
Maha Pengampun lagi Maha Penyayang. [Q.S. an-Nisa (4): 129].
Menurut Yusuf Qardhawi bahwa Islam adalah agama yang sejalan dengan
fitrah manusia  mengakui fakta yang dapat membimbing dan manjauhkan manusia
dari perbuatan dungu. Inilah kenyataan yang memaksa Islam membolehkan
poligami. Sebelum Islam datang  agama-agama terdahulu telah membolehkan
praktek poligami sampai seratus isteri tanpa terikat oleh syarat dan aturan. Itulah
kultur yang terjadi di masyarakat dahulu. Islam datang tidak menghapus secara serta
merta sistem poligami Jahiliyah  yang sudah mendarah daging namun membangun
aturan poligami penerapan pembatasan jumlah istri tidak boleh lebih dari empat di
samping adanya syarat-syarat lain yang berhubungan dengan keadilan.
Islam turun di tengah-tengah masyarakat jahiliyah dalam kondisi poligami
yang berlebihan dan agar Islam diterima oleh mereka pada saat itu  maka Islam
membolehkan praktik menikah dengan batasan empat orang istri.
Dengan demikian  hukum asal pernikahan dalam Islam adalah monogami.
Sebab syarat keadilan menjadi syarat berat bagi setiap suami yang akan
melaksanakan pernikahan lebih dari seorang istri.

C. Poligami dalam Ajaran Islam
1. Pengertian dan Hukum Poligami
Secara kebahasaan yang lebih tepat adalah poligini yang dalam kamus bahasa
Indonesia diartikan sebagai Sistem perkawinan yang membolehkan seorang pria
memiliki beberapa wanita sebagai isterinya di waktu yang bersamaan. Namun
dalam tulisan ini  selanjutnya penulis cenderung untuk menggunakan istilah
poligami untuk pembahasan dimaksud  yaitu poligami yang bermakna pologini
(suami beristeri lebih dari satu) karena selain bisa dibenarkan secara kebahasaan juga
istilah tersebut sudah populer penyebutannya di masyarakat untuk laki-laki yang
beristeri lebih dari satu.
Di masyarakat seperti sekarang ini  sikap berpoligami bagi sebagian laki-laki
seakan menjadi sesuatu yang dianggap mudah untuk dilakukan karena hanya semata
mengikuti nafsu biologis dan tidak mengikuti aturan yang sebenarnya. Memang
Pada asalnya hukum poligami itu diperbolehkan jika seseorang suami tidak
dikhawatirkan berbuat zhalim terhadap isteri-isterinya. Jika dipastikan akan berlaku
zhalim  maka seorang suami lebih baik untuk beristeri satu saja.
Islam diperuntukan untuk semua jenis dan golongan manusia serta
memelihara kepentingan dan kemashlahatan yang bersifat pribadi dan umum.
Nampaknya kebolehan poligami karena untuk mewujudkan kemashlahatan bagi
manusia agar tidak berlaku zina dan tidak terjatuh ke dalam pintu kemaksiatan.
Dengan kata lain menurut Mahmud Syaltut  bahwa pada asalnya Islam
memerintahkan laki-laki untuk beristeri satu  boleh beristeri lebih dari satu jika
dipandang darurat.
Yusuf Qardhawi menjelaskan kondisi darurat yang membolehkan seorang
suami berpoligami adalah sebagai berikut: pertama  ditemukan seorang suami yang
menginginkan keturunan  akan tetapi ternyata isterinya tidak dapat melahirkan anak
disebabkan karena mandul atau penyakit. Kedua  Di antara suami ada yang memiliki
overseks  akan tetapi isterinya memiliki kelemahan seks  memiliki penyakit atau masa
haidhnya terlalu panjang sedangkan suaminya tidak sabar menghadapi kelemahan
isterinya tersebut. Ketiga  jumlah wanita lebih banyak dibanding jumlah laki-laki 
khususnya setelah terjadi peperangan. Di situ terdapat kemashlahatan yang harus
10

didapat oleh sebuah masyarakat dan para wanita yang tidak menginginkan hidup
tanpa suami dan keinginan hidup tenang  cinta dan terlindungi serta menikmati sifat
keibuan.
Namun permasalahan yang harus dihadapi bahwa kebolehan seorang suami
untuk beristeri lebih dari satu bukan hanya dikarenakan kondisi mendesak
sebagaimana tersebut di atas. Dibolehkan juga suami berpoligami tanpa alas an-
alasan dharurat  tetapi yang harus diperhatikan adalah izin dari istri sebelumnya dan
prinsip-prinsip keadilan untuk memperlakukan para istrinya dalam memberikan
nafkah lahir dan batin. Kewajiban bagi seorang suami untuk berlaku adil dalam
memberikan nafkah terhadap isteri-isterinya adalah konsekuensi dari tindakan
berpoligami dalam Islam. Sikap adil dimaksud berarti seorang suami dapat
memenuhi hak kewajibannya terhadap isteri-isterinya secara proporsional sesuai
dengan kebutuhan secara wajar.
Nafkah itu ada yang bersifat lahiriyah  yaitu nafkah yang bersifat materi dan
immateri (batiniyah). Sehubungan dengan pembagian nafkah tersebut maka keadilan
pun terbagi mejadi dua yaitu keadilan dalam memberikan nafkah lahiriyah dan
keadilan dalam memberikan nafkah batiniyah. Pada keadilan bentuk pertama 
seorang suami dituntut untuk berlaku adil terhadap isteri-isterinya dalam
memberikan makan  minum  pakaian  rumah  serta waktu giliran. Pemenuhan rasa
keadilan bentuk pertama ini sangat mungkin dapat dilakukan oleh seorang suami
terhadap isteri-isterinya. Maka jika seorang suami tidak dapat berlaku adil dalam
nafkah lahir ini yang mengakibatkan isteri-isteri terzalimi  maka haram bagi laki-laki
untuk berpoligami. Allah swt berfirman dalam al-Quran surat al-Nisa ayat 3:

Artinya: Siapa yang memilki dua orang isteri tapi ia lebih berpihak kepada salah satunya 
maka pada hari qiamat ia berjalan dalam keadaan menarik salah satu pundaknya (miring).
(HR. Abu Daud)
Adapun sesuatu yang dianggap perbuatan menzalimi dalam Hadits di atas
adalah ketidak-adilan seorang suami dalam memenuhi hak-hak isteri yang
dipandang kuasa bagi suami untuk memenuhinya seperti nafkah lahir dan waktu
gilir.
Terkait dengan keadilan bentuk kedua yakni keadilan yang bersifat batin ( DO JREN DRN'
J P(DRNBDR')  kecenderungan hati/cinta. Usaha untuk berlaku adil dalam membagi cinta
kepada isteri-isteri inilah yang sesungguhnya sangat berat bagi seorang suami. Dan
hal ini sudah bisa dipastikan tidak dapat dilakukan oleh suami untuk berlaku adil
sebagaimana diisyaratkan oleh al-Quran:

Artinya: Dan kamu sekali-kali tidak akan dapat berlaku adil di antara isteri- isteri (mu) 
walaupun kamu sangat ingin berbuat demikian  karena itu janganlah kamu terlalu
cenderung (kepada yang kamu cintai)  sehingga kamu biarkan yang lain terkatung-katung.
Dan jika kamu mengadakan perbaikan dan memelihara diri (dari kecurangan)  maka
sesungguhnya Allah Maha Pengampun lagi Maha Penyayang. (QS. an-Nisa:129)
Kalau seandainya keadilan membagi cinta ini menjadi syarat yang mutlak bagi
seorang suami  maka tertutup hukum kebolehan bagi seorang suami untuk
berpoligami meskipun sudah berada pada kondisi yang darurat. Oleh karena sulitnya
beralaku adil dalam membagi cinta  maka Menurut Yusuf Qardhawi ini adalah
keadilan yang dimaafkan dan diberikan toleransi  namun tidak termaafkan untuk
nafkah lahir.
Ayat ini juga dapat dipahami bahwa seorang suami yang berpoligami tidak
hanya untuk berkomitmen untuk adil  karena ayat tersebut memastikaan bahwa siapa
pun seorang suami tidak akan pernah bisa berbuat adil kepada isteri-isterinya  karena
itu penting keharusan adanya maslahat yang lebih besar untuk isteri-isteri dan anak-
anaknya. Perhatikan bagaimana tingginya konflik berumah tangga bagi para suami
yang beristeri lebih dari satu  perseteruan antar para isteri  kecemberuan buta 
12

permusuhan antara para anak  perebutan harta waris dan dosa-dosa yang
ditimbulkan akibat perilaku berpoligami. Karena itu  pikirkan kemaslahatan yang
lebih penting jika melakukan poligami seperti untuk kepentingan dakwah 
mendapatkan keturunan hebat  dan kemaslahatan buat seluruh anggota keluarganya.
Contoh praktik poligami ideal adalah Baginda Rasulullah saw yang selalu
berusaha untuk berlaku adil sampai kepada masalah bepergian dan untuk memenuhi
rasa keadilan tersebut  Rasulullah mengundi di antara isteri-isterinya. Bagi yang
keluar undiannya  maka dialah yang menjadi teman pergi Rasulullah  hal ini
dilakukan oleh Rasulullah supaya tidak melukai perasaan dan meminta kerelaan dari
isteri-isteri yang tidak pergi bersama Rosul. Bukan hanya itu  Beliau berpoligami
hanya semata untuk kepentingan dakwah sebab istri-istri yang dinikahi oleh beliau
adalah wanita-wanita yang sangat memerlukan bantuan  lihatlah sosok wanita yang
beliau nikahi semuanya adalah janda kecuali Sayidatuna Aisyah r.a.
Meskipun poligami diizinkan dalam ajaran Islam dengan syarat-syarat ketat 
tetapi realitasnya ternyata menyisakan penderitaan bagi istri  orang tua dan anak-
anak. Hancurnya rumah tangga dan putusnya cinta kasih di antara mereka  bahkan
anak yang tidak berdosa pun sering menjadi korban. Karena itu  poligami hendaknya
dihindari oleh setiap suami  sebab mengandung kemudharatan bagi setiap anggota
keluarga. Hal ini terungkap dalam hadis Nabi SAW Riwayat Imam al-Bukhari 
Muslim  Turmudzi dan Ibnu Majah dari Miswar bin Makhramah yang mengangkat
peristiwa yang dialami keluarga putri Nabi SAW (Fatimah) ketika Ali akan
melakukan poligami.
Miswar bin Makhramah berceritera bahwa ia mendengar Rasulullah SAW berdiri di
atas mimbar seraya berkata  Sesungguhnya keluarga Hisyam bin al-Mughirah meminta
izinku untuk menikahkan putrinya dengan Ali bin Abi Thalib. Aku tidak izinkan. Aku tidak
izinkan. Aku tidak izinkan. Kecuali jika Ali bin Abi Thalib lebih memilih menceraikan putriku
dan menikah dengan putrinya (Keluarga Hisyam). Sesungguhnya putriku adalah darah
dagingku  menyusahkannya berarti menyusahkanku dan menyakitinya berarti
menyakitiku [H.R. al-Bukhari  Muslim  at-Turmudzi dan Ibnu Majah].
Hadits di atas mempertegas prinsip monogami dalam pernikahan. Nabi SAW
melarang Ali bin Abi Thalib untuk melakukan poligami  bahkan beliau meminta Ali
memilih menceraikan Fatimah putri Nabi jika tetap menikahi gadis tersebut. Alasan
yang diajukan Rasulullah adalah beliau tidak rela andaikan poligami itu akan
13

menyusahkan dan menyakiti putri tercintanya Fatimah  yang berarti menyakiti
perasaan Rasulullah SAW sebagai ayahnya.
Jika kedua kelompok hadis di atas digabungkan  dapat dipahami bahwa hadis-
hadis tentang poligami tidak menyebutkan bahwa poligami itu perbuatan sunah atau
yang dianjurkan. Poligami dalam Islam merupakan ketentuan pembatasan yang
pernah terjadi sebelumnya (yang tidak terbatas). Poligami dilakukan dengan
memenuhi ketentuan adil.
2. Hikmah dari Poligami
Berpoligami bagi sebagian orang terkadang tidak terlalu sulit untuk dilakukan.
Permasalahannya adalah tidak mudah untuk berlaku adil dalam memenuhi sesuatu
yang menjadi hak para isteri. Terlihat  banyak suami yang beristeri lebih dari satu
tapi sebenarnya mereka tidak mampu untuk memberikan nafkah. Motif mereka
berpoligami bukan karena masalah darurat  tapi karena ingin memperturutkan hawa
nafsu seksual. Kalaupun mereka mampu memberikan nafkah namun terkadang
perlakuan suami kepada isteri-isterinya banyak berlaku tidak adil dalam pemenuhan
kebutuhan seperti makan  pakaian  tempat tinggal  dan waktu bergilir.
Oleh karena itu  alasan kebolehan berpoligami bagi sang suami dikarenakan
terdapat kondisi darurat dan syarat beraku adil terdapat hikmah di dalamnya yang
Menurut Rasyid Ridha sedikitya terdapat empat hikmah. 1) Untuk mendapatkan
anak bagi suami yang subur dan isteri yang mandul. 2). Menjaga keutuhan keluarga
tanpa harus mencerai isteri pertama meski ia tidak berfungsi semestinya sebagai isteri
karena cacat fisik dan sebagainya. 3). Untuk menyelamatkan suami yang hiperseks
dari perbuatan free sex. Tercatat di beberapa negara Barat yang melarang poligami
mengakibatkan merajalelanya praktek prostitusi dan free sex (kumpul kebo) dan
lahirnya anak-zina yang mencapai jumlah cukup tinggi. 4). Menyelamatkan harkat
dan martabat wanita dari krisis akhlak (melacur)  terutama bagi mereka yang tinggal
di negara yang jumlah wanitanya lebih banyak dibanding laki-laki akibat peperangan
misalnya.
Sedangkan hikmah kebolehan Rasulullah beristeri lebih dari empat bukanlah
karena dorongan hawa nafsu sebagaimana yang dituduhkan oleh kaum orientalis 
14

tapi mengandung hikmah yang besar  yaitu kepentingan dakwah Islam sebagaimana
dikemukakan oleh Abbas Mahmud al-Aqqad sebagai berikut:
a. Untuk kepentingan pendidikan dan pengajaran agama. Semua isteri Nabi yang
berjumlah sembilan dapat dijadikan sumber informasi bagi umat Islam yang
hendak mengetahui ajaran-ajaran Nabi dan praktek kehidupan beliau dalam
berkeluarga  bermasyarakat  terutama masalah rumah tangga.
b. Untuk kepentingan politik  yaitu mempersatukan suku-suku bangsa Arab dan
sekaligus menarik mereka masuk Islam. Seperti perkawinan Nabi dengan
Juwairiyah putri al-Harist kepala suku bani al-Musthaliq dan Shafiyah  seorang
tokoh dari Bani Quiraizhah dan Bani al-Nadhir.
c. Untuk kepentingan sosial dan kamanusiaan. Seperti perkawinan beliau dengan
janda dermawan bernama Khadijah dan janda pahlawan Islam seperti Saudah
binti Zumaah (suaminya meninggal setelah kembali dari hijrah ke Abesenia) 
Hafsah binti Umar (suaminya gugur pada perang badar)  Hindun Ummu Salamah
(suaminya gugur di perang Uhud).
Seandainya saja motif Rasul untuk nikah lebih dari satu karena dorongan sex 
mungkin wanita yang dinikahi adalah gadis-gadis cantik bangsa Arab. Tetapi hal itu
sama sekali tidak dilakukan oleh Rasulullah tapi justru dengan Siti khadijah yang
umurnya lebih tua 15 tahun dibandingkan umur beliau. Demikian dengan isteri-isteri
beliau yang lain  semuanya dinikahi bukan karena tuntutan nafsu  tapi bermotif
dakwah yang ternyata motif tersebut dapat membantu keberhasilan tugas beliau
sebagai utusann Allah. Dengan demikian  pada pernikahan Rasul terdapat hikmah
yang tinggi yang bernilai dakwah  pendidikan dan sosial kemasyarakatan.
Argumentasi logis di atas dapat meruntuhkan segala tuduhan negatif yang
dilontarkan oleh kaum orientalis terhadap kebolehan rasul bersiteri lebih dari satu.
Lebih lanjut Syaikh Al-Jarjawi menguraikan pula hikmah pembatasan
poligami sampai empat orang istri  yaitu: pertama  jumlah empat istri merupakan
kompilasi dari empat unsur bumi dan merupakan symbol atas kesinambungan
spesies manusia. Kedua  jumlah empat sesuai dengan sumber nafkah yakni
kepemimpinan  perdagangan  pertanian dan industry. Ketiga  empat adalah jumlah
pembagian cuaca dalam setahun  pergantian yang memperbaiki semua sendi
15

kehidupan manusia  kehidupan tumbuhan  dan kehidupan binatang. Keempat 
empat orang istri dianggap cukup untuk mendapatkan setiap mereka satu hari
kemudian menanti dalam rentang waktu tiga hari lainnya. Rentang waktu tiga hari
ini dirasa cukup untuk menumbuhkan kerinduan dan kasih ssayang. Seorang istri
tidak bisa menanti lebih dari waktu tersebut. Kelima  sesungguhnya syariat
menjadikan jumlaha tiga sebagai tambahan karena ia sudah menjadi satu standarisasi
umum dalam banyak hukum di berbagai negara.
Poligami dengan Batasan empat orang istri memang diperbolehkan oleh
syariat Muhammad tetapi dengan syarat berlaku adil kepada semua istrinya. Tetapi
waspadalah  Ketika suami tidak mampu memberikan hak yang sama pada setiap
istrinya  maka terkoyaklah urusan rumah tangganya dan buruklah bahtera rumah
tangganya pada akhirnya akan membawa permasalahan besar bagi setiap anggota
keluarganya. Para istri pun disibukkan dengan pertengkaran antara mereka 
memperebutkan harta suaminya  sehingga melupakan kewajiban mereka untuk
mengatur rumah tangga. Itulah aspek-aspek yang menjadi pertimbangan seorang
berpoligami. Karena itulah surat an-Nisa ayat 3 secara tegas &.Kemudian jika kamu
takut tidak akan dapat berlaku adil  maka kawinilah seorang saja. (QS. An-Nisa:3).
D. Nikah Mutah
Semarak nikah mutah atau sering disebut dengan nikah kontrak tampaknya
masih menghiasi kehidupan sebagian kecil masyarakat. Keprihatinan dan kehwatiran
pun muncul dari orang tua  tokoh masyarakat  pendidik bahkan ulama terhadap
pernikahan yang terkesan main-main ini. Praktek nikah mutah seperti tersebut
terjadi selain karena terdapat legitimasi dari kelompok yang membolehkan  juga
ditemukan alasan untuk terhindar dari perzinahan demi memenuhi tuntutan sex
sesaat. Untuk dapat menguji keabsahan nikah mutah yang banyak dilakukan oleh
orang yang tinggal jauh dari isterinya karena memenuhi tugas kerja misalnya  bahkan
tak luput pelakunya adalah pemuda dan mahasiswa  berikut ini akan dijelaskan
tentang hukum nikah mutah.
1. Pengertian dan Dasar Nikah Mutah.
Kata mutah ( )N9R*EO )  berasal dari bahasa Arab yang mempunyai arti bekal yang
sedikit dan barang yang menyenangkan. Pengertian ini sejalan dengan kata mutah
16

yang terdapat dalam al-Quran yang berarti bercampur (bersenang-senang bersama
istri dengan bersenggama) dan pemberian yang menyenangkan oleh suami kepada
isterinya yang dicerai. Firman Allah swt:

Artinya: Tidak ada kewajiban membayar (mahar) atas kamu  jika kamu menceraikan
isteri-isterimu sebelum kamu bercampur dengan mereka dan sebelum kamu menentukan
maharnya. Dan hendaklah kamu berikan suatu mut`ah (pemberian) kepada mereka. Orang
yang mampu menurut kemampuannya dan orang yang miskin menurut kemampuannya
(pula)  yaitu pemberian menurut yang patut. Yang demikian itu merupakan ketentuan
bagi orang-orang yang berbuat kebajikan. (QS. Al-Baqarah: 236)
Yusuf Qardhawi memberikan pengertian nikah mutah secara terminologi 
yaitu seorang laki-laki mengikat (menikahi) seorang perempuan untuk waktu yang
ditentukan dengan imbalan uang yang tertentu pula. Di Indonesia  kawin mutah ini
popular dengan sebutan kawin kontrak.
Uraian di atas memeberikan gambaran cukup jelas tentang nikah mutah.
Bahwa tidaklah nikah mutah itu dilakukan  kecuali kecenderungan seseorang untuk
memenuhi kebutuhan seksual  berakhir tanpa talaq (cerai) karena secara otomatis jika
sudah habis waktu kontrak yang telah ditentukan maka berakhir lah riwayat
pernikahan itu. Dilihat dari penetapan pembatasan waktu (taqit) tersebut 
pernikahan semacam itu bertentangan dengan syariat Islam yang menghendaki
pernikahan itu tidak terbatas oleh waktu.
2. Hukum Nikah Mutah
Nikah mutah pada zaman Nabi pernah diperbolehkan namun tidak berlaku
untuk semua orang hanya untuk orang tertentu dikarenakan terdapat suatu kondisi
yang sangat mendesak. Menurut Yusuf Qardhawi  rahasia diperbolehkan nikah
mutah pertama kali pada zaman Nabi  karena umat ketika itu berada pada masa
transisi dari dunia Jahiliyah ke dunia Islam. Pada zaman Jahiliyah  perzinahan
merupakan budaya yang sudah menyebar luas. Ketika Islam mewajibkan kepada
kaum untuk pergi berjihad  mereka merasakan sangat berat tinggal jauh dengan
isteri-isteri mereka. Di antara kaum yang ikut berijihad dengan Rosulullah itu ada
yang memiliki iman yang kuat dan ada yang lemah. Mereka yang lemah imannya
17

sangat takut terjerumus ke jurang perzinahan. Sedangkan mereka yang kuat imannya
bersikeras untuk menghilangkan nafsu seksnya dengan cara mengebiri  sebagaimana
informasi Hadits yang diriwayatkan oleh Ibnu masud:

Artinya: Kami ikut berperang dengan Rosulullah dan istri-istri kami tidak ada di samping
kami. Kemudian kami bertanya kepada Rosulullah  bolehkah kami mengebiri? Maka
Rosulullah melarang kami untuk mengebiri dan memberikan keringanan kepada kami
untuk menikahi perempuan dengan membayar imbalan untuk waktu yang ditentukan.
(HR. Bukhari Muslim)
Berdasarkan keterangan di atas  maka jelaslah bahwa kebolehan hukum nikah
mutah pada zaman Nabi itu memiliki alasan sebagai berikut:
a. Merupakan keringanan hukum (rukhsah) untuk memberikan jalan keluar dari
problematika yang dihadapi oleh dua kelompok orang yang imannya kuat dan
imannya lemah.
b. Sebagai langkah perjalanan hukum Islam menuju ditetapkannya kehidupan
rumah tangga yang sempurna untuk mewujudkan semua tujuan pernikahan yaitu
melestarikan keturunan  cinta kasih sayang dan memperluas pergaulan melalui
perbesanan.
Terkait dengan hukumnya  dilihat dari prosesnya nampaknya langkah
pengharaman nikah mutah yang ditempuh oleh Islam dilakukan secara priodik
seperti proses pengharaman khamar. Rasulullah SAW memperbolehkan nikah mutah
dalam kondisi tertentu (darurat)  kemudian Rasulullah SAW mengharamkan nikah
mutah sebagai bentuk pernikahan. Sebagaimana Hadits yang diriwayatkan oleh
Imam Muslim dalam Shahihnya dari Syibrah al-Juhani bahwasanya ia berperang
bersama Rasulullah saw pada waktu fathu Makkah  maka Rasulullah mengizinkan
mereka untuk melakukan nikah mutah. Ia berkata: Maka kaum tetap melakukan
nikah mutah itu sampai Rasulullah mengharamkan nikah mutah. Dan dalam redaksi
yang lain  terdapat Hadits yang berbunyi
