It states that a fasting blood glucose level below 100 mg/dl is considered normal  while a level between 100-126 mg/dl indicates impaired glucose tolerance (pre-diabetes)  and a level of 126 mg/dl or above on two separate occasions confirms the diagnosis of diabetes.

The report also mentions that the possible causes of a high blood glucose level could be due to stress  anxiety  exaggerated response of insulin  and other factors that can affect blood glucose levels  especially in women with lower body weight and those who are physically active.

After several months  while walking in the night it was necessary - to watch ground to keep from falling.
exami
Although his legs were as strong as ever  he would stagger and sway from side to side as he walked. On
and te
examination there was no weakness or atrophy of the muscles  but when relaxed  they did not exhibit
normal tone. The knee jerk was abolished. There was complete loss of sense of posture and passive move-

QUESTIONS
1.
What is your diagnosis sensory Ataxia

Heading: Case History

A 34-year-old man noticed tingling sensations in his feet  followed by shooting pain in his legs. After several months  he had difficulty walking at night  needing to watch the ground to avoid falling. On examination  his legs were strong  but he would stagger and sway while walking. There was no muscle weakness or atrophy  but the muscles lacked normal tone when relaxed. The knee jerk was absent  and there was complete loss of proprioception (sense of posture and passive movement) and vibratory sense in the legs. There was also loss of tactile localization and discrimination.

{{MEDICALLY_RELEVANT}}
Heading: Diagnosis and Affected Tracts

1. Diagnosis: Sensory ataxia
2. The damaged tracts are the dorsal column tracts.
3. The incoordination of the legs while walking and the loss of proprioception (sense of posture and passive movement) are due to the impairment of the dorsal column tracts  which are responsible for transmitting proprioceptive information from the legs to the brain.

The ESR is elevated  which can indicate the presence of inflammation or other underlying medical conditions. The ESR is a non-specific test that can be influenced by various factors  including age  gender  and the presence of certain diseases. Further clinical evaluation and additional tests may be necessary to determine the underlying cause of the elevated ESR.

Heading: Case History

A black smith aged 18 years came with a history of burns in his right hand. Examination showed loss of pain and temperature sensibility over the thorax and both upper extremities. There was no loss of touch sensibility  no ataxia or loss of motor functions except that there was weakness and atrophy of the small muscles of both hands.

{{MEDICALLY_RELEVANT}}
Heading: Diagnosis

The diagnosis is Syringomyelia.

{{MEDICALLY_RELEVANT}}
Heading: Tactile Sensibility Sparing

Tactile sensibility was spared because in syringomyelia  the lesion typically involves the central gray matter of the spinal cord  which contains the pain and temperature pathways  while the dorsal columns that carry touch and proprioception are spared.

{{MEDICALLY_RELEVANT}}
Heading: Site of Lesion

The site of the lesion is in the central gray matter of the spinal cord.

{{MEDICALLY_RELEVANT}}
Heading: Atrophy of Small Hand Muscles

The atrophy of the small muscles of both hands is due to the involvement of the anterior horn cells in the spinal cord  which innervate these muscles  by the syrinx (fluid-filled cavity) in the central gray matter.

Findings:
- Differentiation of cerebral cortex and medulla is identified with cerebral sulcal configuration appropriate for age.
- No focal low/high signal pathological lesions are seen within the cerebral parenchyma.
- Perivascular spaces are present in the bilateral basal ganglia.
- No diffusion restriction on DWI sequences or pathological signal void on SWAN sequences.
- The interhemispheric fissure is seen in the midline.
- The ventricular system is symmetrically normal  with no signs of obstruction.
- The pons and cerebellum are within normal limits.
- On the FIESTA sequence  there is a suspected contact between the right anterior-inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) and the right VII-VIII nerve complex in the cisternal segment.
- Hyperintensity on T2W is seen in the frontonasal duct  ethmoid  and bilateral maxillary sinuses.
- Thickening of the right middle and inferior nasal turbinates is noted  more prominent on the right side.
- No pathological signal is seen in the mastoid air cells.

Impression:
- No acute infarct/hemorrhagic lesions or intracranial mass lesions are identified.
- Suspected AICA contact with the right VII-VIII nerve complex in the cisternal segment  differential diagnosis includes AICA loop.
- Bilateral frontonasal duct  ethmoid  and maxillary sinus disease; hypertrophy of the nasal turbinates  more prominent on the right side.

The provided raw text appears to contain some medically relevant information  likely a blood test report. However  the text is not in a clear  structured format  and some of the abbreviations and values are not easily interpretable. 

Based on the available information  the key elements that can be extracted are:
- IMA
- HM 8T1
- Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C): 4.9 (reference range not provided)

The rest of the text is not clearly interpretable and may contain additional test results or other medical information  but without more context  it is difficult to determine the exact nature of the document. Further clarification or a more structured medical report would be needed to provide a comprehensive interpretation.

Heading: Explanation

1. The loss of pain and temperature sensation on the left side is due to the injury of the ipsilateral spinothalamic tract  which crosses horizontally in the lesion.
2. The spastic paralysis and loss of proprioception in the right leg is due to the injury of the contralateral corticospinal and posterior column-medial lemniscus pathways.
3. The wasting of the right hand muscles and loss of sensation along the right ulnar border is due to the involvement of the ipsilateral C8 spinal segment.
4. The dorsal column tract is intact  explaining the preserved proprioceptive sensation.

Heading: Aspergillosis Infection Treatment

The provided text discusses a 44-year-old patient with an aspergillosis infection who is to receive treatment with amphotericin B. The question asks which adjunctive measure is used to lessen the occurrence of nephrotoxicity associated with amphotericin B treatment.

The correct answer is D. Normal saline boluses.

Amphotericin B is a potent antifungal medication  but it can also cause nephrotoxicity (kidney damage) as a side effect. To help mitigate this  normal saline boluses (rapid intravenous infusion of a salt solution) are commonly used as an adjunctive measure to help maintain adequate hydration and kidney function during amphotericin B treatment.

The other options are not the correct adjunctive measures for reducing amphotericin B-associated nephrotoxicity:
A. Test dose of amphotericin is not an adjunctive measure for reducing nephrotoxicity.
B. Furosemide is a diuretic that can actually worsen kidney function in this context.
C. Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine used for premedication to prevent infusion reactions  not specifically for reducing nephrotoxicity.

A 19 year old man met with a car accident. He lost consciousness for a short time  and when he awoke
secould not move any of his limbs  not could he feel any sensation in his trunk or limbs. After a month he could
as
move his sholder to some extent  but otherwise all four extremities remained paralysed. At this time he
developed increased muscle tone and hy peractive stretch reflexes in both arms and legs. Also when either foot
was dorsiflexed sustained clonus of the ankle was seen. Babinski sign could be elicited bilaterally. Stimulation
ofone foot caused withdrawal of that foot and also flexion of the other leg. He had to be catheterised to allow
drainage of the urinary bladder.

Heading: Questions

1. What is the neurological abnormality produced by the accident?
2. What is the level of the lesion?
3. Why were the stretch reflexes hyperactive?

{{MEDICALLY_RELEVANT}}
Heading: Answers

1. The neurological abnormality produced by the accident is an upper motor neuron lesion (UMNL).

2. The level of the lesion is at the cervical spinal cord.

3. The stretch reflexes were hyperactive due to the recovery of reflex excitability caused by the denervation hypersensitivity. This is due to the loss of inhibitory control of supraspinal centers  leading to exaggerated reflexes.

The stages of the patient's condition are:
1) Stage of spinal shock - Hypotension
2) UMN lesion
3) Recovery of reflex excitability due to denervation hypersensitivity of the gamma motor neurons.
