Heading: Ultrasound Abdomen Report

The ultrasound abdomen report indicates the following findings:

- Liver is enlarged in size  measuring 24 cm  with normal shape and echotexture. Multiple well-defined heterogeneous hypoechoic lesions are seen in both lobes of the liver  the largest measuring 11 x 10.5 x 13.8 cm in the right lobe. Most of these lesions show a target sign  and the larger ones have an internal cystic component likely indicating necrosis. Peripheral vascularity is seen on color flow. The largest lesion in the left lobe of the liver measures 5.4 x 5.1 cm in segment II.
- Intrahepatic bile ducts are not dilated. The portal vein is dilated  measuring 14.6 mm  and shows turbulent flow.
- The gallbladder is partially distended  with a clear visualized lumen and normal wall thickness. The common bile duct is within normal limits.
- The pancreas is normal in size and echopattern.
- The spleen is normal in size and echopattern.
- Both kidneys are normal in size  shape  and echopattern  with no space-occupying lesions or hydronephrosis.
- The urinary bladder is partially distended  with a clear lumen and normal wall thickness.
- The uterus is anteverted and normal in size  with an endometrial thickness of 3.4 mm. No gross adnexal masses are seen bilaterally.
- Minimal inter-bowel free fluid is seen in the pelvis.

Impression:
In a known case of GIST (Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor) on Imatinib  the present scan shows hepatomegaly with multiple liver lesions and minimal ascites. The findings need to be correlated clinically and with previous records.

MR Myelography coronal and sagittal images. POST GADOLINIUM CONTRAST SCAN WAS
DONE
CLINICAL PROFILE: PAST HISTORY OF SURGERY OF SPINE. NO DETAILED HISTORY
AVAILABLE
FINDINGS:
Post op laminectomy with orthopedic fixator is seen at L4 level with disc implant at L4-5.
Marrow oedematous changes are seen in adjacent endplate of L4-L5 level with its
erosion-? infective aetiology.
Post-contrast study shows ill-defined inhomogeneous enhancement of the endplate and
prevertebral soft tissue
There is thin strip of bone visible in superior aspect of the screw at the level of L5
vertebral body-? loosening.
Rest of the vertebrae show normal marrow signal intensity.
Spondylotic changes as evidenced by anterior osteophytes are seen.
Degenerative changes are seen involving intervertebral disc of lower lumbar spine as
evidenced by loss of normal hyperintense signal on T2-weighted images.
L1-2  L2 3 IVD level: Mild posterior disc bulge indenting the dural sac and abutting
bilateral traversing nerve roots.
L4-L5 IVD level: There is endplate erosion and hyperintensity at this level with
prevertebral and subdural soft tissue collection suggestive of infective aetiology  the
maximum prevertebral soft tissue measures 8 mm on left side  causing moderate
narrowing of central canal and both lateral recesses compressing bilateral traversing
nerve roots.
Generalized mild facetal arthropathy and ligamentum flavum thickening is seen.
Dorsal cord shows normal signal intensity.
No evidence of other intra-spinal mass.
AP spinal canal measures 12.7 mm at L1-L2  12.3 mm at L2-L3  12.3 mm at L3-L4  11.7 mms

Liver enzyme tests  formerly called Liver Function Test (LFTs)  are a group of blood tests that detect inflammation and
damage to the liver. They can also check how well the liver is working. Most often  a liver test panel is ordered as
a
routine lab test. Many doctors check the liver in new patients or during annual physicals examination.
Liver tests may be done together in a panel or tested separately.
The liver filters and processes blood as it circulates through the body. It metabolizes nutrients  detoxifies harmful
substances  makes blood clotting proteins  and performs many other vital functions. The cells in the liver contain proteins
called enzymes that drive these chemical reactions. When liver cells are damaged or destroyed  the enzymes in the cells
leak out into the blood  where they can be
measured by blood tests.

Interpretation:
SUMMARY:- C-reactive protein (CRP) is a normal serum constituent present in healthy individuals in very low concentrations Invasive
bacterial infection and extensive tissue damage cause CRP levels to increase. CRP levels rise rapidly and increased values can be
detected within 6 to 12 hours after an inflammatory process has begun. Hence the CRP level is usually clearly elevated when a patient
is admitted to hospital. CRP values peak and normalize considerably more quickly than to other parameters of inflammation
Complications should they occur  cause the CRP values to increase again or to be elevated constantly.
CRP Measurement of CRP concentrations provides valuable information for the diagnosis of bacterial infections especially in neonates. The
concentration has been reported to be a sensitive indicator for use when monitoring the efficacy of antimicrobialtimes therapy for
to the follow up of bacterial infections  and for controlling and monitoring postoperative infections. Monitoring CRP. levels may contribute
the early recognition of intercurrent complications occuring after myocardial infarction. Method Name: Turbidimetry Requested Test

Comments:
The laboratory results indicate the following:
- Total eGFR is within the normal range  suggesting normal kidney function.
- Gliko Hb (HbA1c) is elevated at 8.7%  indicating poor glycemic control  consistent with a diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus.
