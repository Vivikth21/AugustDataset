 REMARKS:
 TSH STIMULATES THE THYROID GLAND TO PRODUCE THE MAIN THYROID HORMONES T3 AND T4. IN CASE OF HYPERTHYROIDISM, TSH LEVEL IS SEVERELY INHIBITED AND MAY EVEN BE UNDETECTABLE. IN CASE OF PRIMARY HYPOTHYROIDISM, TSH LEVEL IS NOT REDUCED, SINCE THE NEGATIVE FEEDBACK CONTROL OF THYROID HORMONES HAS NO EFFECT. IN CASE OF PRIMARY HYPOTHYROIDISM, TSH LEVELS ARE ALWAYS MUCH HIGHER THAN NORMAL AND THYROID HORMONE LEVELS ARE LOW. THE TSH ASSAY AIDS IN DIAGNOSING THYROID OR PITUITARY DISORDERS. THE T4 ASSAY AIDS IN ASSESSING THYROID FUNCTION, WHICH IS CHARACTERIZED BY A DECREASE IN THYROXINE LEVELS IN PATIENTS WITH HYPOTHYROIDISM AND AN INCREASE IN PATIENTS WITH HYPERTHYROIDISM. THE T3 PLAYS AN IMPORTANT PART IN MAINTAINING EUTHYROIDISM.

 REMARKS:
 1. BUN MASS UNITS CAN BE CONVERTED TO UREA MASS UNITS BY MULTIPLYING BY 2.14.
 2. SODIUM IS THE MAJOR EXTRACELLULAR CATION AND FUNCTIONS TO MAINTAIN FLUID DISTRIBUTION AND OSMOTIC PRESSURE. DECREASED SODIUM LEVELS CAN BE CAUSED BY PROLONGED VOMITING OR DIARRHEA, DIMINISHED REABSORPTION IN THE KIDNEY, AND EXCESSIVE FLUID RETENTION. INCREASED SODIUM LEVELS CAN BE CAUSED BY EXCESSIVE FLUID LOSS, HIGH SALT INTAKE, AND INCREASED KIDNEY REABSORPTION.
 3. POTASSIUM IS THE MAJOR INTRACELLULAR CATION AND IS CRITICAL TO NEURAL AND MUSCLE CELL ACTIVITY. DECREASED POTASSIUM LEVELS CAN BE CAUSED BY REDUCED DIETARY INTAKE OR EXCESSIVE LOSS FROM THE BODY DUE TO DIARRHEA, PROLONGED VOMITING, OR INCREASED RENAL EXCRETION. INCREASED POTASSIUM LEVELS CAN BE CAUSED BY DEHYDRATION OR SHOCK, SEVERE BURNS, DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS, AND RETENTION OF POTASSIUM BY THE KIDNEY.
 4. CHLORIDE IS THE MAJOR EXTRACELLULAR ANION AND SERVES TO REGULATE THE BALANCE OF EXTRACELLULAR FLUID DISTRIBUTION. DECREASED CHLORIDE CAN BE CAUSED BY REDUCED DIETARY INTAKE, PROLONGED VOMITING, REDUCED RENAL REABSORPTION, ACIDOSIS, AND ALKALOSIS. INCREASED CHLORIDE CAN BE CAUSED BY DEHYDRATION, KIDNEY FAILURE, SOME FORMS OF ACIDOSIS, HIGH DIETARY OR PARENTERAL CHLORIDE INTAKE, AND SALICYLATE POISONING.",Other,Valid,Blood & Urine

 1. LIVER: NORMAL IN SIZE AND ECHO PATTERN, WITH NO FOCAL LESIONS AND NORMAL INTRAHEPATIC BILE DUCTS.
 2. GALLBLADDER: DISTENDED, WITH A MOBILE GALLBLADDER CALCULUS MEASURING 16 MM. THE GALLBLADDER WALL THICKNESS IS NORMAL, AND NO WORM OR MASS IS SEEN.
 3. COMMON BILE DUCT: NORMAL IN CALIBER (3 MM), WITH NO CALCULUS OR WORM SEEN.
 4. PANCREAS: NORMAL IN SIZE AND ECHO PATTERN, WITH NO PANCREATIC MASS OR CALCIFICATION. THE PANCREATIC DUCT IS ALSO NORMAL.
 5. SPLEEN: NORMAL IN SIZE AND ECHO PATTERN, WITH A NORMAL SPLENIC VEIN.
 6. KIDNEYS: BOTH KIDNEYS SHOW INCREASED CORTICAL ECHOGENICITY. THE LEFT KIDNEY UPPER POLE HAS TWO CORTICAL CYSTS, THE LARGEST MEASURING 14X12 MM. THERE IS NO CALCULUS, HYDRONEPHROSIS, OR MASS SEEN.
 7. ADRENALS: BOTH ADRENALS ARE NORMAL, WITH NO ADRENAL MASS SEEN.
 8. AORTA: NO PARA-AORTIC OR CELIAC LYMPHADENOPATHY.
 9. PERITONEAL CAVITY: NO FREE FLUID SEEN.

THE ESTIMATED AVERAGE GLUCOSE OF 225.95 MG/DL ALSO CONFIRMS THE PRESENCE OF UNCONTROLLED HYPERGLYCEMIA.

 MEAN NORMAL PROTHROMBIN TIME (MNPT): 14.4 SEC
 INR 1.36 
 
 TEST INTERPRETATION:
 - INCREASED PT MAY BE DUE TO:
 1. VITAMIN K DEFICIENCIES
 2. DRUGS (E.G. COUMARIN-TYPE DRUGS FOR ANTICOAGULANT THERAPY)
 3. SEVERE LIVER DAMAGE (E.G. CIRRHOSIS)
 4. HYPOFIBRINOGENEMIA (ACQUIRED OR INHERITED)
 5. POOR FAT ABSORPTION (E.G. OBSTRUCTIVE JAUNDICE, HEPATITIS, COLITIS, DIARRHOEA, SPRUE, STEATORRHEA, CELIAC DISEASE)
 6. POISONING
 
 THEREFORE, IT IS ADVISABLE TO FOLLOW UP INR VALUE RATHER THAN JUST PT VALUE.
 
 THERAPEUTIC RANGE: 
 THE INR IS A VERY SENSITIVE REAGENT FOR PATIENTS ON ORAL ANTICOAGULANT THERAPY. THE RECOMMENDED INR RANGE IS 2 - 3, EXCEPT FOR PREVENTION OF MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION WHERE THE INR MAY BE MAINTAINED BETWEEN 2.5 - 3.5.

 LIVER ENZYME TESTS, FORMERLY CALLED LIVER FUNCTION TEST (LFTS), ARE A GROUP OF BLOOD TESTS THAT DETECT INFLAMMATION AND DAMAGE TO THE LIVER. THEY CAN ALSO CHECK HOW WELL THE LIVER IS WORKING. MOST OFTEN, A LIVER TEST PANEL IS ORDERED AS A ROUTINE LAB TEST. MANY DOCTORS CHECK THE LIVER IN NEW PATIENTS OR DURING ANNUAL PHYSICALS EXAMINATION.
 LIVER TESTS MAY BE DONE TOGETHER IN A PANEL OR TESTED SEPARATELY.
 THE LIVER FILTERS AND PROCESSES BLOOD AS IT CIRCULATES THROUGH THE BODY. IT METABOLIZES NUTRIENTS, DETOXIFIES HARMFUL SUBSTANCES, MAKES BLOOD CLOTTING PROTEINS, AND PERFORMS MANY OTHER VITAL FUNCTIONS. THE CELLS IN THE LIVER CONTAIN PROTEINS CALLED ENZYMES THAT DRIVE THESE CHEMICAL REACTIONS. WHEN LIVER CELLS ARE DAMAGED OR DESTROYED, THE ENZYMES IN THE CELLS LEAK OUT INTO THE BLOOD, WHERE THEY CAN BE MEASURED BY BLOOD TESTS.",Other,Valid,Blood & Urine

 INTERPRETATION:
 SUMMARY:- C-REACTIVE PROTEIN (CRP) IS A NORMAL SERUM CONSTITUENT PRESENT IN HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS IN VERY LOW CONCENTRATIONS INVASIVE
 BACTERIAL INFECTION AND EXTENSIVE TISSUE DAMAGE CAUSE CRP LEVELS TO INCREASE. CRP LEVELS RISE RAPIDLY AND INCREASED VALUES CAN BE
 DETECTED WITHIN 6 TO 12 HOURS AFTER AN INFLAMMATORY PROCESS HAS BEGUN. HENCE THE CRP LEVEL IS USUALLY CLEARLY ELEVATED WHEN A PATIENT
 IS ADMITTED TO HOSPITAL. CRP VALUES PEAK AND NORMALIZE CONSIDERABLY MORE QUICKLY THAN TO OTHER PARAMETERS OF INFLAMMATION
 COMPLICATIONS SHOULD THEY OCCUR, CAUSE THE CRP VALUES TO INCREASE AGAIN OR TO BE ELEVATED CONSTANTLY.
 
 CRP MEASUREMENT OF CRP CONCENTRATIONS PROVIDES VALUABLE INFORMATION FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF BACTERIAL INFECTIONS ESPECIALLY IN NEONATES. THE
 CONCENTRATION HAS BEEN REPORTED TO BE A SENSITIVE INDICATOR FOR USE WHEN MONITORING THE EFFICACY OF ANTIMICROBIAL THERAPY FOR
 THE FOLLOW UP OF BACTERIAL INFECTIONS, AND FOR CONTROLLING AND MONITORING POSTOPERATIVE INFECTIONS. MONITORING CRP LEVELS MAY CONTRIBUTE
 TO THE EARLY RECOGNITION OF INTERCURRENT COMPLICATIONS OCCURRING AFTER MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.

 - TOTAL EGFR IS WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE, SUGGESTING NORMAL KIDNEY FUNCTION.
 - GLIKO HB (HBA1C) IS ELEVATED AT 8.7%, INDICATING POOR GLYCEMIC CONTROL, CONSISTENT WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF DIABETES MELLITUS.
 - TOTAL CHOLESTEROL IS WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE.
 
 THE PATIENT SHOULD BE ADVISED TO IMPROVE GLYCEMIC CONTROL THROUGH APPROPRIATE LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS AND MEDICATION MANAGEMENT TO REDUCE THE RISK OF DIABETIC COMPLICATIONS.",Other,Valid,Other

 TEST NAME: TOTAL IGE
 RESULT: 453.27 IU/ML
 BIO. REF. RANGE: 0-15 IU/ML
 
 INTERPRETATION:
 IMMUNOGLOBULIN E (IGE) IS ONE OF THE 5 CLASSES OF IMMUNOGLOBULINS AND IS DEFINED BY THE FC REGION. IT IS THE MOST RECENTLY DESCRIBED IMMUNOGLOBULIN, HAVING FIRST BEEN IDENTIFIED IN 1966. IGE IS PRESENT IN CIRCULATION AT VERY LOW CONCENTRATIONS, APPROXIMATELY 300-FOLD LOWER THAN THAT OF IGG. THE PHYSIOLOGICAL ROLE OF IGE IS NOT FULLY CHARACTERIZED, ALTHOUGH IT IS THOUGHT TO BE INVOLVED IN DEFENSE AGAINST PARASITES, SPECIFICALLY HELMINTH INFECTIONS.
 
 THIS TEST IS HELPFUL IN EVALUATING PATIENTS WITH SUSPECTED DISEASES ASSOCIATED WITH ELEVATED IGE LEVELS, INCLUDING ALLERGIC DISEASE, PRIMARY IMMUNODEFICIENCIES, INFECTIONS, MALIGNANCIES, OR OTHER CONDITIONS. THIS ALSO HELPS IN EVALUATION OF PATIENTS WITH SUSPECTED ALLERGIC BRONCHOPULMONARY ASPERGILLOSIS (ABPA).
 
 FOR PATIENTS WITH AN ESTABLISHED DIAGNOSIS OF ALLERGIC DISEASE, MEASUREMENT OF TOTAL IGE CAN HELP IDENTIFY CANDIDATES FOR OMALIZUMAB (ANTI-IGE) THERAPY AND FOR DETERMINATION OF PROPER DOSING. IN ADDITION TO OTHER DEMOGRAPHICS AND CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS, CANDIDATES FOR OMALIZUMAB MUST HAVE TOTAL IGE LEVELS BETWEEN 30 AND 700 KU/L.",Other,Valid,Other
